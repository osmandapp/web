This is a tremendous example of how a small change in the OpenStreetMap API could make an impact on other applications. As part of our OsmAnd Live initiative, we've collected detailed statistics about OSM changes over the last 2 years. As of today, we've gathered information about all changesets, all users and all editors. What is unique about our stats is that we are also collecting them by multiple world regions.

But we've always been asked to focus on how many objects were changed rather than how many changesets are submitted. This month that change was finally merged into the platform <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/1947">https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/1947</a>. So the rest of the implementation was pretty clear for us and it is finally in place as well.

### URLs and APIs

You can view all stats at <a href="https://osmand.net/osm_live">https://osmand.net/osm_live</a> and browse by specific month and regions. It is also available via JSON API i.e. <a href="https://osmand.net/reports/query_report?report=all_contributions_requests&month=2018-09&region=">Worldwide</a> and <a href="https://osmand.net/reports/query_report?report=all_contributions_requests&month=2018-09&region=belarus_europe">Belarus</a> for example.
