# 15 Years of OsmAnd

Hi everyone,

Today is a special day — OsmAnd is turning 15. An incredible number! It feels like we were just writing posts about our [5th anniversary](https://osmand.net/uk/blog/five-years) and [10th anniversary](https://osmand.net/uk/blog/ten-years), and now, it's already been fifteen years. Time flies when you're passionate about what you do.

Looking back, I realize that the magic of OsmAnd isn't just about code or maps. Above all, it's about people. And today, I want to give a huge, sincere thank you to the three main communities without whom none of this would be possible.

## Thank You for Being with Us!

#### To our OsmAnd Team
To the people who create, improve, and support the project every single day. Your dedication, talent, and persistence are the fuel for our shared journey. Thank you for the thousands of hours of work and for pouring your hearts into every detail.

#### To our GitHub Community
To everyone who sends us code, reports bugs, suggests ideas, and participates in discussions. You are our external brain and our strictest, yet fairest, critics. Your involvement is what makes OsmAnd a truly open and vibrant project. Thank you for your contributions!

#### To the OpenStreetMap Community
Our foundation and main source of inspiration. Every trail, every house, every detail on the map is the work of millions of volunteers from around the world. You are creating a digital copy of the planet, accessible to everyone, and we are proud to be part of this movement. Without you, there would be no us. Thank you!

## Our Journey and Focus on the Future
The scale of this journey is truly humbling. Over the past 15 years, we’ve delivered more than 35 releases for the Android version — and over 25 releases for iOS since its launch.

Today, we’re proud to share these global stats:

- 2.5 million monthly active users (MAU) across all platforms
- Over 100,000 daily active users (DAU)
- More than 20 million installs worldwide

All these 15 years can be roughly divided into three stages. For the first five years, we built the very basic functionality—offline maps and navigation that just worked. Over the next five years, we transformed OsmAnd into a full-fledged application with plugins, extensive settings, and professional tools. We dedicated the third five-year period to deep internal work: completely rewriting and improving key components like the rendering engine and routing algorithms.

Now, a new, fourth stage begins. We have reached functional maturity, and our main goal for the near future is to polish what we’ve already built. We will focus on stability, speed, and consolidation. User expectations are growing, and what was once considered normal must now be flawless. The application must run faster, be more stable, and feel more cohesive.

How will we achieve this? Through immense attention to detail: deep analysis, manual and automated testing. We will move in fast but very small steps, carefully monitoring the results and listening to your feedback. Our task is to consolidate existing functionality, making it more intuitive and reliable.

I believe this approach will allow us to build a solid foundation. And after that, we can focus with renewed energy on the major, long-awaited features that you constantly write to us about and for which we previously lacked the time.

Victor Shcherb
