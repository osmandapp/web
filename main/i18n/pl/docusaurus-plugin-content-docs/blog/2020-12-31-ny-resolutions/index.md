## 2020 achievements

2020 was the Covid-19 pandemic year and it was a very difficult year for us and the whole travel industry. Thank you all who kept supporting us throughout the whole year. We really needed it!
This year we mostly focused on functionality and maintainability. Many features were completely restructured internally and even more importantly we’ve managed to reorganize our small team of 20 people to grow our competency in many fields.
In June 2020 our company <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/ten-years">celebrated 10 years old</a>. We made a Mega Sale with 90% off and gave out more than 150 T-shirts to our Expert users who managed to pass tricky Quiz.

## New Year Resolutions 2021

We are going to start next year with an extended team of 12 software engineers. We grew +70% compared to the previous year and it is good news. We can probably do 30% more in 2021 :-)
Our list is growing every year and, as of today, we have around 1700 requests waiting to be fixed or implemented. That’s why it is important for us to set up some public goals and try to follow them to a certain extent.

### Resolutions 2021:

* Travel and Track Collections (Android & iOS)
* Full export / import and online Backup (Android & iOS)
* Improve Tracks UI & Navigation with Altitude Graph (Android & iOS)
* Plan Route with Track Approximation (follow up on iOS)
* Custom user icons for Favorites (follow up on iOS)
* Plugins & UI Customization (follow up on iOS)
* Quick Action Panel (Android)		

We’re also looking forward to many improvements in our search, routing & rendering. We hope to surprise you with new useful features and hope that in 2021 OsmAnd will be more useful for your trips than in 2020.
**Happy 2021 and let’s welcome 2021 OsmAnd Users and OsmAnd Team!**
