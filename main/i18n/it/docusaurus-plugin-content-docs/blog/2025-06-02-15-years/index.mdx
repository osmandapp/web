## ðŸŽ‰ OsmAnd Turns 15!

This June, OsmAnd celebrates its **15th birthday**.

Fifteen years ago, we set out to build a navigation app powered by open data, built for travelers, mappers, and explorersâ€”and committed to offline freedom and user privacy.

<!--truncate-->

Today, OsmAnd is used by **millions of people around the world**. From hiking remote trails to mapping unmapped towns, you've shown whatâ€™s possible when people are empowered by open-source tools.

I want to personally thank every one of youâ€”users, contributors, translators, testers, developers, and supporters. You've helped us grow OsmAnd into what it is today.

Letâ€™s keep building, mapping, exploringâ€”together.
**Hereâ€™s to 15 years of OsmAndâ€”and to the road ahead.**

â€” **Victor**,
Founder of OsmAnd

* **Buy directly from our website.** We've added the ability to purchase our products directly from [osmand.net/pricing](https://osmand.net/pricing). Learn more about how it works in [our documentation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/web).
* **New "OsmAnd XV" purchase.** To celebrate our anniversary, we are introducing a special offer: an **OsmAnd Pro subscription for 15 years**! Everyone who purchases "OsmAnd XV" will also receive **two branded T-shirts** as a gift. After purchase, a Google Form will be sent to you to select sizes and colors.

Letâ€™s celebrate **15 years of exploration**â€”together!
