Yes, we're developing a fully functional [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88mwfoC2RySqIOEvxJIv0A) to provide you with the most interesting information about OsmAnd, mapping and using the power of OSM in your daily life.

<!--truncate-->

You may remember that we've [started the channel](/blog/osmand-videos) a while ago, but back than it was mainly a collection of the videos from other users. Now, we are starting the creation of our own content to give the most fresh and accurate information first-hand. We'll be making tutorials on some basic features and uncovering some not-so-obvious ways to use the app.  You'll see the features before their official release and will be able to discuss them with the team direcly in the comments.

See you on [OsmAnd Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88mwfoC2RySqIOEvxJIv0A).
