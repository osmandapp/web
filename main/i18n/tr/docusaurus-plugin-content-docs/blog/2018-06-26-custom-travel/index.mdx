Custom Travel tool helps you create your own travel guide and use it via OsmAnd Travel feature. Basically, you can use the text from any source (from Wikipedia to your friend's blog) and pair it with a GPX track.

<!--truncate-->

<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./customtravel_1.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
    <th><img src={require('./customtravel_2.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
        </tr>
</table> 

## Prepare the files

To start, please prepare your files. Save your track with '.GPX' extension and the text file as '.html'. In order to create your custom database successfully, the names of the GPX file and the html have to be identical. For example, 'Milan.gpx' and 'Milan.html'.

The GPX tracks can be downloaded from the internet or you can create one (using OsmAnd or any online GPX creation tool).
For example, you can use <!-- <a href="https://ridewithgps.com">RideWithGps</a> service,  --> <a href="https://www.gpsies.com/createTrack.do">GPSies</a>, or a simialr one.
Add the points you'd like to visit into your route and then save that route as a GPX track. <!-- After that, upload it to your phone and open using OsmAnd. You can also view other people's routes or check  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces">OpenStreetMap GPX tracks</a>-->.


<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./gpsies_track_create.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
        </tr>
</table> 

Preparing your GPX track in OsmAnd is also possible, you can read about it here: <a href="https://osmand.net/features/measure-distance">Measure distance</a>.
Choosing the source for your guide's text is completely up to you. It can be  <a href="http://www.touropia.com/tourist-attractions-in-milan/">an article</a> in a travel blog, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan">Wikipedia page</a>, etc. Simply copy the text, then paste it into a text editor and save it with an 'HTML' extension. Make sure to make the name of the GPX track and the HTML file identical.
