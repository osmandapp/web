## Designed for Ski Navigation  

The [**Skiing profile**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#overview) comes with the [**Winter and Ski map style**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#winter-and-ski) enabled by default, showing piste networks, ski lifts, lighting, and terrain details.

With the [**Skiing navigation**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/routing/ski-routing), routes are optimized specifically for skiing activities—factoring in piste direction, type, and difficulty. Trails are color-coded from beginner-friendly green slopes to expert-level yellow runs.  

## Understand Your Map  

To explore piste details, open the [**Ski map legend**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map-legend/ski-map) to identify slope types and conditions. You can also enable additional map layers:  
- **Piste grooming** (Menu → Configure map → Map rendering → Details → Piste grooming) shows whether a trail is groomed and suitable for your preferred skiing style.  
- **Ski slopes and routes** (Menu → Configure map → Routes → Ski slopes and routes) highlights all the pistes OsmAnd can use for navigation, often shown in violet outside ski resort boundaries.  

## Go Beyond Daylight  

Love skiing after sunset? Activate **Night mode** or **Sunrise/Sunset mode** for comfortable viewing in the dark (**Menu → Configure map → Map mode**). You can also turn on **Street lighting** to see which pistes are illuminated for night skiing.  

OsmAnd’s **Skiing profile** combines detailed OpenStreetMap data with powerful navigation to bring the mountain directly to your fingertips. Explore the pistes, check the difficulty, and set your route—then enjoy the ride!
