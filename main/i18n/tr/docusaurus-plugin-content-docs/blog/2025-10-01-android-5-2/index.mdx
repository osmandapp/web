## New Nautical Map Style

["Marine"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#marine) is a new nautical map style designed for maritime navigation. This style displays [light characteristics](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Lights), [sectorial lights](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Sectored_and_Directional_Lights), and other maritime features. The Map Configure menu after enabling "Marine" style has additional options for customization in the "Other map attributes" section.

## New Trip Recording Widgets

New widgets for [Trip Recording](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#widgets) include Max Speed, Average Slope, and an improved Uphill/Downhill widget that now shows total ascent and descent:

- Average Slope widget displays average slope for the last downhill or uphill section of the recorded track (can be set in settings or by tap to the widget).

![Trip Recording Widgets](./img/slope1.png)

- Max Speed widget shows the maximum speed reached during the recording. Tap to switch between the overall max speed and the max speed of the last uphill or downhill (or choose modes in settings).

![Trip Recording Widgets](./img/speed.png)

- Improved [Uphill/Downhill widgets](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#duration-uphill-downhill), now its can show or the sum of all ascents/descents, or the last ascent/descent of the currently recorded trip.

![Trip Recording Widgets](./img/downhill.png)

- [Distance widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording?current-os=android#distance-start-stop) shows total distance of the recorded track, with modes to view the distance of the last ascent and descent.

![Trip Recording Widgets](./img/distance.png)


## Map Rendering Speed

We have optimized the [map rendering engine (OpenGL)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/global-settings#map-rendering-engine) to improve performance for rendering maps and map elements, resulting in a smoother experience when navigating and interacting with the map.

## Base Autosync to Cloud

OsmAnd now supports base [automatic synchronization of your settings and data to the OsmAnd cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud), ensuring that your data is always backed up and accessible from any device.

### US Parameters for Fuel Consumption

Added [US parameters](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/issues/22816) for fuel consumption, allowing users to view fuel efficiency in US gallons per hour, US gallons per 100 miles, and Kilometers per US gallons. 

And for [Remaining fuel](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#vehicle-metrics-widgets): Volume (US gallons)


## Improvements for "Analyze by Interval"

### Added Heart Rate Metrics

If your GPX track contains info about heart rate, you can now monitor your heart rate during activities with the "Analyze by Interval" feature. You can see your average, maximum, and minimum heart rate for each interval and for the entire track.

### Added Downhills/Uphills Analyze

Now, you can split your track for [analyzing downhills, uphills and flats](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/track-context-menu#split-by-uphill-downhill) segments.

_OsmAnd menu ‚Üí Configure profile ‚Üí General Settings ‚Üí Screen orientation ‚Üí Landscape (inverted), Portrait (inverted)_

## Improved UI for Truck Metrics

Now, you can add special truck metrics for Truck profile directly from [the profile settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/vehicle-parameters):

_Menu ‚Üí Configure profile‚Üí Navigation Settings ‚Üí Vehicle parameters: Max axle load, Max weight at full load_

## More Parameters for Routes

Now, you can choose more parameters for [routes selection](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/routes). For example, you can select Hiking routes by OSMC of Regional walking networks.

## Other Improvements

### Updates copying Waypoints

Added [option](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/track-context-menu?current-os=android#actions-with-groups) to copy waypoints between different Favorites folders or create new ones.

![Waypoints](./img/waypoints.png)

### Improved UI for Multiregion Download

The UI for downloading multiple regions has been improved for better usability and fixing issue with routing for large files. For example, Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany can be downloaded as multiple regions with 4 files instead of one large file: _Regierungsbezirk Stuttgart, Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe, Regierungsbezirk Freiburg, Regierungsbezirk T√ºbingen_.

![Multiregion Download](./img/multi_download.png)

### Target Android 15-16 (API level 35)

OsmAnd now targets [Android 15-16](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15) (API level 35), ensuring compatibility with the latest Android features and improvements.

-->

### Update Follow Track Mode

The ["Follow Track"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation#follow-track-options) mode has been updated to improve the user experience when navigating along a recorded track with Reverse mode. Now it supports two options: 
- _Original track_: follows the exact track back to the start.
- _Calculate route_: calculates a new, optimized route back to the start.

### New Screen for Add Track Waypoints

A new screen for [adding waypoints](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu?current-os=android#-add--edit-track-waypoint) to a track has been introduced, allowing users to easily add and manage waypoints while recording a track or for an existing tracks on the map.
