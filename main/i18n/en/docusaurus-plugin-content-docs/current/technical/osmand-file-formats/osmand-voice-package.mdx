# Voice packages {#voice-packages}

<IncompleteArticle/>

OsmAnd supports two types of voice packages:
- **Text-To-Speech** (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech) available on App Stores or preinstalled
- **Recorded Voice packages**, which include recorded voices.

If you could not find the voice package you need, please follow the following examples and create your own voice package. Examples - https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice, German package [de_0.voice.zip](https://download.osmand.net/download?standard=yes&file=de_0.voice.zip), English package [en_0.voice.zip](https://download.osmand.net/download?standard=yes&file=en_0.voice.zip).

### Difference between TTS and Recorded packages {#difference-between-tts-and-recorded-packages}

- a Text-To-Speech engine supports Street Name, Refs, POI names pronunciation
- all Text-To-Speech supported packages bundled and updated with an application
- a Recorded Package needs to be installed and updated manually (although the configuration file could be updated with app update)
- a Recorded Package may not support some correct forms, and support is limited
- a Recorded Package does not require any proprietary TTS engine to be installed

### Package Structure {#package-structure}

Voice package usually is distributed as .voice.zip, where the zip contains one folder with [lang_tts.js](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/voice/de/de_tts.js) (main **configuration** file), and sound files if they are present.

The configuration files are written in JavaScript language. All configuration files are by default TTS-packages, even if there is no TTS present yet to support the language. And later the configuration is extended by mapping 'dictionary phrases' to 'recorded file names'.

```
function populateDictionary(tts) {
	// ROUTE CALCULATED
	dictionary["route_is1"] = tts ? "Die berechnete Strecke ist" : "route_is1.ogg";
	dictionary["route_is2"] = tts ? "lang" : "route_is2.ogg";
	dictionary["route_calculate"] = tts ? "Route neu berechnet" : "route_calculate.ogg";
	dictionary["distance"] = tts ? "die Entfernung beträgt" : "distance.ogg";

	// LEFT/RIGHT
	dictionary["prepare"] = tts ? "Demnächst " : "prepare.ogg";  // Demnächst sounds better then Vorbereiten zum
	dictionary["after"] = tts ? "nach" : "after.ogg";

	dictionary["left"] = tts ? "links abbiegen" : "left.ogg";
  .....
}

function route_recalc(dist, seconds) {
	return dictionary["route_calculate"] + (tts ? ", " : " ") + distance(dist, "nominativ") + (tts ? ", " : " ") + dictionary["time"] + " " + time(seconds) + (tts ? ". " : " ");
}
```

### Generation custom package {#generation-custom-package}

Please check the [project resources](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/) and use the same folder structure as the [German package](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice/de) - simply make copy. Once it's done you can change, run the [generation script](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/voice/gen_voice.sh#L4) and specify the required arguments. Help is inside the script.

### Testing voice package (Android) {#testing-voice-package-android}

For testing, you can use:
- navigation;
- navigation simulation;
- or a convenient version of the [OsmAnd development plugin](/docs/user/navigation/guidance/voice-navigation#testing-of-voice-prompts), which simulates different voice commands for testing.
