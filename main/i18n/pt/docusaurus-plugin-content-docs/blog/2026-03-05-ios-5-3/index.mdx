## New Trip Recording Widgets {#new-trip-recording-widgets}

### Multiple Display Modes {#multiple-display-modes}

Some Trip Recording widgets support multiple display modes. They let you switch between overall trip values and metrics for the most recent uphill or downhill section of the currently recorded trip. See the list of available modes [here](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#display-modes).

### Max Speed Widget {#max-speed-widget}

[Max Speed widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#additional-widgets) shows the maximum speed for the currently recorded trip in the selected mode: *Total (default)*, *Last downhill*, or *Last uphill*.

![widgets](@site/static/img/widgets/tr_rec_wid_max_speed.png)

### Average Slope Widget {#average-slope-widget}

[Average Slope widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#additional-widgets) displays the average slope for the last uphill or downhill section of the current trip, depending on the selected mode.

![widgets](@site/static/img/widgets/tr_rec_wid_average_slope.png)

### Moving Time Widget {#moving-time-widget}

[Moving Time widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#additional-widgets) shows the moving time for the currently recorded trip, or the time for the last uphill and downhill, depending on the selected mode.

## Weather Quick Actions {#weather-quick-actions}

New quick actions make it easier to control [weather layers](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#configure-map) directly from the map. **Show/Hide – Weather layers** works as a master toggle for all active weather layers. When turned off, it hides all currently enabled weather layers. When turned on again, it restores exactly the same set of layers that were active before. **Show/Hide – Wind animation** allows you to quickly enable or disable the wind animation layer independently.

## Speedometer Widget {#speedometer-widget}

[Speedometer widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#speedometer) now shows visual speeding alerts with color-coded tolerance and limit-exceed states, including animated transitions when crossing speed thresholds.

## CarPlay Enhancements {#carplay-enhancements}

CarPlay features a new [“You have arrived” screen](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/car-play#finish-navigation) with post-arrival actions and smarter disconnect handling (auto-finish near the destination, or pause and resume at low speed).

![Finish Navigation](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/finish_navigation_carplay_new.png)

## Map Buttons: Visibility & Appearance {#map-buttons-visibility-and-appearance}

Map buttons can now be fully customized. You can control the [visibility](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#button-appearance) and adjust the [appearance](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#map-button-appearance) of both default and custom (Quick Action) buttons.

## Unsupported Maps Management {#unsupported-maps-management}

The [Updates](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources?current-os=ios#updates-menu) tab now detects unsupported and overlapping region maps. If a map has been deprecated and replaced by smaller regional maps, it appears under a new Unsupported maps section. You can review the list, remove outdated maps individually or use Delete all to clean them up at once (with confirmation). Large overlapping region maps are hidden to prevent duplication and confusion, helping keep your map data organized and up to date.

## Updates copying Waypoints {#updates-copying-waypoints}

Added [option](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/track-context-menu?current-os=ios#actions-with-groups) to copy waypoints between different Favorites folders or create new ones.

## Adjustable Position Icon Size {#adjustable-position-icon-size}

You can now resize the [My Location position icon](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles?current-os=ios#my-location-appearance)  independently from the app’s text size. Separate size settings are available for Resting and Navigation modes, allowing better visibility while driving. The icon size can be adjusted from 50% to 300%, with 100% set as default.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes} 

- Faster opening of context menus when tapping POIs, Favorites, tracks and buildings;
- Correct handling of relation-based POIs on multipolygons;
- Fixed “null” appearing instead of a city name in POI search results and improved night-mode background consistency;
- Restored tappable behaviour for fitness, running and canoe routes with shields.
