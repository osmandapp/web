A new OsmAnd version for iOS is here! The update includes a convenient plugin, more improvements in the POI area and a nicer UI. But let&amp;s discuss every feature in detail.

<!--truncate-->

## Offline Contour Lines Maps

This plugin, being much appreciated by Android users, is now available in the iOS version. It provides you with quite detail info on the terrain of a certain location and the heights. To get the plugin, just go to the in-app purchase area.

<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_14.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
      </tr>
</table> 


## POI improvements &amp; Wikipedia

The POI information has become even fuller: now you can see the opening hours of a location, its phone number and website. Besides that, we thought it would be nice to add the possibility to get Wikipedia information offline, so now you can read about your favorite POI on the go.

<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_10.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_7.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_9.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
      </tr>
</table> 

## Trip recording

In the new version, there&#39;s the ability to add new waypoints to track. While you record the track, you can add waypoints by making a long-tap. You can also add them to a newly-created track without recording.

<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_5.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
      </tr>
</table> 



## More comfortable UI

There are many small changes that are called to make the process of using the app more comfortable. Please let us know what you think of it on our social media pages (Twitter, Facebook).

<table class="blogimage">
  <tr>
    <th><img src={require('./ios_1-1_13.png').default} alt="Image"/></th>
      </tr>
</table> 



And remember that only together we can achieve the best results!
