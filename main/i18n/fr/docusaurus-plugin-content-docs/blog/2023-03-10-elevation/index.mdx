Hi Everybody! 

OsmAnd has the ability to display terrain offline in a variety of ways: contour lines, hillshades, slopes, altitude graphs..

![Hiking](./hiking.png)

<!--truncate-->

In the last releases for Android, we added [Pro features](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features) with Elevation data. The [Elevation widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/nav-widgets#elevation-widget) shows a graph with the elevation and slope of your navigation route and your current location on this graph with the current altitude and slope. The graph is plotted on two axes. The X-axis is the distance of your route. The Y-axis is the altitude above sea level, the value of which depends on the relief, and the slope is displayed as a percentage.

The relief of the terrain has a great influence on the trip. Of course, it's very important to know what uphills and downhills await us on the way. In OsmAnd you can see [the Altitude graph](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details) when building a route. The graphs can be worked with both GPX tracks and routes.  

## Contour lines and Terrain

:::note
Available for Android and iOS. Paid feature.
:::

Contour lines and relief are our first integrated features for the app to customize and display relief information. These features are available for both Android and iOS versions of the OsmAnd app. Read  about it in the [Topography plugin](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography) article.

## Elevation graphs

:::note
Available for Android and iOS. Free feature.
:::

During the navigation route building you are provided with Altitude and Slope data in the form of a [graph](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details), and with the ["Analyze on map"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map#analyze-track-on-map) function you can find out additional, more detailed information about the route.

A detailed description of the graph you can find in the [Altitude section](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/track-context-menu#altitude) of the Track Context Menu article.
