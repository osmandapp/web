## Navigate Winter Slopes Effortlessly

OsmAnd excels for skiing with its **Winter and Ski** map style, offline vector maps, dedicated Skiing profile, and piste-specific navigation tools. This article guides skiers through setup and usage for safe, clutter-free slope exploration.

## Enable Ski Map Plugin and Profile
Install the **Ski Map View plugin** from OsmAnd plugins (paid feature); it activates ski rendering without extra downloads. Create or select **Skiing profile** in Menu → Settings → Profiles for winter-optimized defaults.All pistes draw from OpenStreetMap vector data already in your downloaded maps.

## Download Maps and Set Winter Style
Download vector maps for resorts like Alps or Tatras via Menu → Maps. Switch to **Winter and Ski style**: Android - Menu → Configure map → Map rendering → Map style; iOS - Menu → Map type → Styles → Winter and Ski. This highlights pistes by color (green=easy, black=expert), lifts, and trails while dimming roads.

## Read Piste Legend and Layers
Pistes show as lines: solid groomed, dashed backcountry; tap for difficulty, length, and vert. Enable **Ski slopes and routes** (Menu → Configure map → Routes) for violet outlines on off-resort paths. Layer **Contour lines** and **Hillshade** (Topography plugin) for terrain steepness and freeride planning.

## Plan and Navigate Routes
Use **Ski routing** in Skiing profile: set params like piste difficulty (easy/advanced/expert), off-piste, Nordic, or sled. Search or tap pistes to build turn-by-turn downhill routes; clickable shields show ascent/descent. Combine with GPX import for custom lines over official slopes.
