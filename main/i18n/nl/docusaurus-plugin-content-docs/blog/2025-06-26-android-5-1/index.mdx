### New Point Selection UI

The point selection interface in [Navigation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-navigation) has been redesigned to be more intuitive and user-friendly. The new UI allows you to easily select points on the map, making navigation smoother and more efficient.
