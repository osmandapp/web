Now, you can buy OsmAnd products on [the OsmAnd website](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/web) and use them on your Android or iOS devices, and vice versa. This feature is available for all OsmAnd products, including Maps+ and OsmAnd Pro.

### New Route Information Widget

New [Route information](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/nav-widgets#route-information) widget displays the estimated arrival time, remaining travel time, and distance for the current route. This widget provides essential navigation information at a glance, making it easier to plan your journey and stay informed about your progress.

### Widgets on the Left & Right Panels

Widgets on the [Left & Right panels](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#panels-customization) include a height option, allowing you to customize the size of the widgets to better fit your preferences and screen layout. This change improves the usability of the widgets and makes them more adaptable to different screen sizes.

### Unit of Volume and Fuel Tank Capacity

The ["Unit of Volume"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#other) and ["Fuel Tank Capacity"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/navigation-settings#vehicle-parameters) options have been added to the settings, allowing you to customize how these measurements are displayed in the app. This change enhances the usability of OsmAnd for users who prefer specific units of measurement.

### Coordinates Grid Overlay

A new ["Coordinates Grid" overlay](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps/#coordinates-grid) has been added, providing a visual reference for coordinates on the map. This feature is useful for users who need precise location information and enhances the overall map experience.

### Assign Activities to Tracks

You can now assign [activities to tracks](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/track-context-menu#track-information-activity), allowing you to categorize and organize your recorded tracks more effectively. This feature is particularly useful for users who engage in multiple activities, such as hiking, cycling, or running, and want to keep their tracks organized by activity type.

### Changing Appearance of Favorites

We redesigned [the appearance menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/favorites#favorite-point) of Favorites, allowing you to customize the look of your favorite locations. You can now choose from various icons and colors to make your favorites more visually appealing and easier to identify.
