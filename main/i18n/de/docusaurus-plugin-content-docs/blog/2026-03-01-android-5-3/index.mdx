## What's new

- New experimental [Starwatcher plugin](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/starwatcher) with an astronomical overlay that shows the paths of the Sun, planets and stars on the map, with time and date selection and a dedicated activity screen.
- More [flexible layout](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#panels-layout) for widgets and map buttons: improved placement in landscape mode, better control over visibility and appearance, and a layout that reduces overlaps between widgets, buttons and data fields.
- [3D buildings (beta)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#3d-buildings).
- [Globe view (beta)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#globe-view).
- Smarter track organization and statistics: Smart Folders can automatically group tracks by period, activity, distance, speed, location and other parameters, with clearer summary statistics for each group.

<!--
- Improved **[OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud)** section in Settings: backup data, version history and automatic backup settings are now grouped under a single “OsmAnd Cloud” block with clearer names, icons and storage usage information.
- Updated **[Configure map](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu)** options for routes and road attributes: a clearer legend, better filters for hiking, cycling and MTB networks, plus more control over which route types and icon overlays are visible on the map.
- New and redesigned elevation and navigation widgets: elevation profiles for routes and GPX tracks, uphil
l/downhill metrics, average grade and more detailed elevation information for trips and navigation.
- **[Android Auto](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/auto-car)** improvements, including extended widget support and better OBD II integration, so key vehicle metrics such as speed and fuel-related data are easier to see on the car screen.
- More flexible layout for widgets and map buttons: improved placement in landscape mode, better control over visibility and appearance, and a layout that reduces overlaps between widgets, buttons and data fields.
- Smarter track organization and statistics: Smart Folders can automatically group tracks by period, activity, distance, speed, location and other parameters, with clearer summary statistics for each group.
- Advanced route and track analysis: new graphs for road type, surface, smoothness, steepness, lanes and maximum speed, together with an option to color tracks using a fixed speed palette.
- Ongoing improvements to accessibility features, including more flexible audio and haptic navigation indications and a richer “look around” experience for visually impaired users.
- Initial groundwork for smartwatch integration, preparing support for viewing navigation information and trip recording data on wearable devices.

## Bug fixes 

- Improved stability of **[OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud)** sync and backup, reducing conflicts and ensuring widgets and settings restore correctly across devices.
- Fixed incorrect uphill/downhill values in elevation widgets and improved accuracy of ascent/descent calculations in route analysis.
- Improved **[Android Auto](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/auto-car)** navigation behaviour, including correct exit directions at roundabouts and proper placement of on-screen tools such as the radius ruler.
- Fixed several issues related to **[Accessibility](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/accessibility)** mode, including navigation announcements and interaction with certain map tools.
- General interface and performance fixes across map rendering, widget display and configuration screens.
