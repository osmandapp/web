## Redesign Tracks menu

During the recording, you can view the Recording track data, including distance, duration, and the number of waypoints. There are two key actions available during recording: _Stop record_ and _Save GPX track_.

## Sun position widget

A new [_Sun position_ widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#sun-position) has been added, complementing the Sunrise and Sunset widgets. This section of widgets is now named _"Sun position"_:

_Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Navigation Profile ‚Üí General settings ‚Üí Units & formats ‚Üí Distance during navigation ‚Üí Precise or Round up_

![Round up iOS](./img/round_up_ios.png) ![Round up iOS](./img/round_up_1_ios.png)

![App language](./img/app_language_ios.png)
