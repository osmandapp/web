OsmAnd 1.7 is coming. The biggest breakthrough of this release is a new route planning mode, after any Directions action, which is designed to quickly change start and destination point, tweak parameters and see immediate route recalculation.

* One of the major changes is route calculation engine. It is completely rebuild and gives precise route based on routing parameters.
* To take advantage of all features of new route calculation, maps should be updated as March 2014.
* GPX route calculation is moved under Route Settings button and feature of 'Pass the whole track' enables OsmAnd navigation, so you will always get map instructions even if you deviated from the route.
* Active tunnel simulation (long waiting feature).
* Speech rate setting (accessibility).
* Lots of small &amp; handy features.
