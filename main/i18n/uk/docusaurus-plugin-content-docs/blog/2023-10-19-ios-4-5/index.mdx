### Topography and 3D Relief

*Terrain map* for countries has been added to the [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) menu. This data type can be used to generate [Slopes, Hillshades (paid)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/ios#free-and-paid-features), and 3D maps ([OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/ios#pro-features)).

Our updates:
- The *Contour Lines* plugin has been renamed to the [_Topography_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography) plugin for a more visual and intuitive display of plugin functionality.
- Added support for a new form of [_Terrain map (3D)_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources#map-types) (**paid function**). This map data is used for generated Slopes/Hillshades, 3D map view. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain-map-data).
- [Slope](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography/#slope) and [Hillshades](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography/#hillshade) are now [generated from _Terrain map (3D)_ data](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain).
- Added [*3D Relief*](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#3d-relief) for the map (**paid function**). You can find it here: _Menu → Configure map → Terrain → 3D Relief_. 
- Redesigned [_Topography menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu) in *Configure map* menu. You can find it here: _OsmAnd menu → Configure map → Topography: Contour lines, Terrain, Nautical depth_.
- Added a new [*3D/2D Mode*](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#3d-mode) button for the map screen, and now map tilts can be done not just with a [two-finger gesture](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#gestures). You can set parameters such as *Hidden*, *Visible*, *Visible in 3D mode* for the button. Available here: _OsmAnd Menu → Configure Screen → Buttons → 3D Mode_.
- Changed direction of titlt gesture.

  ** **map tilt angle by button is the last tilt angle by two-finger gestures.**

### New Configure Screen

*Configure Screen* menu has been divided into two sections: **Widgets** and **Buttons**.

- In the [_Widgets_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#widget-panels) section, you can add or remove widgets on the device screen, as well as switch _Transparent_ function on/off for them. Read more about new widget updates [in this article](#widget-updates).
- In the [_Buttons_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#buttons) section, you can add them to the device screen and set parameters for Compass, Quick Action, 3D mode buttons  and switch on/off _Distance by tap_ function.

### Widget updates

We've done a lot of work on the widgets and interface of [the Configure screen](#new-configure-screen).
- The *Configure screen* has been redesigned, separating the widgets from buttons, and the different widget panels more clearly arranged.
- Added pages for widgets.
- Added an option to duplicate widgets.
- Combined the widgets from the left and right panels, and the top and bottom panels.

#### Pages and Duplicates for widgets 

Widgets in the _Left_ and _Right_ panels can be grouped into *Pages*.  

Duplicates can be shown simultaneously for the right and left panels, as well as for each widget page.  

- Available here:  
  _OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (Left / Right panel) → Edit → Add widget/Add page_
- Additional settings menu for widget panels:  
  _OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (panels) → "..." button → Reset to default/Copy from another profile/Help_

#### Average speed widget

This widget shows your average speed for a selected time interval and does not require any other features such as track recording or navigation. You can easily use it to check if your average speed is in line with highway speed limits, or record your average speed for the last 5-15 minutes of cycling.  

Available here: _Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Average speed_

#### True bearing widget

Added new widgets for **Bearing**. Bearing now has 3 separate widgets.

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Bearing_

* **Relative bearing** is the angle between your forward movement direction and the target point.
* **Magnetic bearing** is the clockwise (horizontal) angle between the magnetic north and the target point observed from your location.
* **True bearing** is expressed as the horizontal angle between the geographic meridian and a line on Earth. Specifically, true point bearing is the angle measured in degrees clockwise from the True North line.


### Update for Configure Map 

Added [CAI (Club Alpino Italiano)](https://www.cai.it/) scale to classify the [difficulty of routes](https://montanarilife.com/2016/07/03/hiking-trail-rating-systems-italy/).  

_OsmAnd Menu → Configure map → Routes → Difficulty classification_
