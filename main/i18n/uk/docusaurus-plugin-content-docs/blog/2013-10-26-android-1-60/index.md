New major release is rolled out. It has lots of small &amp; useful features. We completely redesigned how the map rendered, now you would not see view freezes while dragging the map. Here is the short list of new features :

* Support of Full HD devices
* Support transparent map background (allow to see map over satellites view)
* Show downloaded maps and facilitate downloading missing maps directly from the map view
* Contour line map files now bundled for countries/regions
* New world basemap with major roads, railroads, and major areal features like forests
* Map magnifier feature (long click on zoom button) * Useful both for tile and vector maps
* Define/edit custom online tile sources (and specify expiration time)
* Support of time conditional speed limits (Netherlands for example)
* Faster search address input
* Bug fixes with routing and rendering

And remember that only together we can achieve the best results!
New features are coming SOON!
