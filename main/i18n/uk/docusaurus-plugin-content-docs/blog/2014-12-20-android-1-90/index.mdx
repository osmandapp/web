* New options like showing road access restrictions, the road surfaces, the road surface quality etc. have been implemented in many map styles.
* Increase map details level independently from map text size.

## OsMo plugin

* Login/Logoff functionality
* Automatically download groups and devices for registered users
* Better error handling

## Simplification of background trip recording and background navigation

* OsmAnd now automatically enables the GPS sleep mode service if navigation or trip recording has been activated, so that this continues to function while the device screen is off. Only if desired, the GPS sleep mode service can still be manually interrupted or configured via tapping the "GPS status" widget.

* Easier to download and update maps

* Print itinerary and turn information


And remember that only together we can achieve the best results!
New features are coming SOON!
