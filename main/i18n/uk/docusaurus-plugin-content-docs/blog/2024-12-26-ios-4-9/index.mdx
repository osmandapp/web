## New Compass Behavior

The compass button has been updated to provide more intuitive and user-friendly functionality. These improvements make the compass easier to use, help you navigate better, and optimize map orientation control during navigation.

[Compass button](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Reorients the map *to the North* regardless of the current orientation mode. In *Compass direction* mode, the map briefly aligns to the North before returning to the dynamic orientation.
- **Double tap**. Cycles through orientation modes, such as GPS direction or device rotation. This function replaces the previous *Single tap* behavior for switching modes.
- **Long tap**. Opens a menu with all map orientation modes, letting you choose your preferred setting.


### Locked Map Rotation

![North is up](./img/north_locked.png)

A much-requested feature, [locked map rotation](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/issues/17561#issuecomment-1623105410), now ensures the map remains consistently oriented with North at the top when the compass is set to the [**North is up**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#map-orientation-modes) mode.

In this configuration, map rotation is disabled, but you can still zoom in and out freely. This enhancement is perfect if you prefer a stable reference point while navigating.


## Search by Brand Names

![Brand name iOS](./img/brand.png)

We're excited to introduce a new [brand search](https://osmand.net/docs/user/search/search-poi#how-to-use) feature in OsmAnd, designed to help you find specific places by allowing searches for POIs using brand names.

Whether you're looking for a favorite coffee shop, hotel, or a trusted supermarket, this addition makes locating more efficient. Instead of typing generic categories, you can search directly for brands, personalizing your search results to better fit your needs. This feature not only saves time but also enhances the overall navigation experience.


## Widget Context Menu

![Widget Context menu iOS](./img/widget_context_menu.png)

The [widget context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen/#panel-widgets-settings) empowers you to manage and customize widgets directly from the map screen.  

With a ***long tap*** on any widget, you can access its context menu to adjust settings or reconfigure layouts without navigating away from the map. This streamlined approach keeps your focus on navigation while providing the flexibility to personalize the map screen on the go.


## Redesigned Graphs

![Graph iOS](./img/graph.png)

Elevation graphs have been redesigned to improve clarity. One significant enhancement is the repositioning of Y-axis labels to eliminate overlap with the graph lines, ensuring all data remains readable at a glance.  

This visual update makes it easier to analyze elevation changes and other graph-based information while planning routes or reviewing tracks. 


## Track Menu Updates

The latest OsmAnd version introduces exciting updates to the Track Menu, making it easier to organize, search, and review your tracks efficiently.

### Total Tracks Statistics

![Track stats iOS](./img/track_stats.png)

You can now view comprehensive [tracks statistics](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#folder-statistics) right at the bottom of each folder. These details include:

- Number of tracks
- Total distance
- Uphill and downhill elevation
- Duration
- Overall folder size

For example:  
`Tracks â€“ 4, distance â€“ 246.6 km, uphill â€“ 325 m, downhill â€“ 456 m, duration â€“ 08:50:35, Total size â€“ 14 MB.`  

This feature simplifies keeping track of your activities at a glance!


### Tracks Filters for Search

![Track filters iOS](./img/track_filters.png)

Finding specific tracks is more convenient than ever with the new [track filters](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/smart-folder/#search-filter). You can filter results based on criteria like duration and length, ensuring you locate the exact track you need.


### Sort Subfolders

![Track filters iOS](./img/subfolders_ios.png) ![Track filters iOS](./img/subfolders_1_ios.png)

Improved sorting functionality in the [Tracks tab](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#folder-actions), now enables you to organize subfolders systematically. Sorting options make it effortless to navigate your tracks, whether grouped by activity, location, or other preferences.


## Updates for Map Mode Menu

![Map mode iOS](https://osmand.net/assets/images/map_mode_4-9_ios-ca48bf82a5918214a8819924e38cdb72.png)

The *map mode menu* now includes an [auto-theme switch](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#map-mode) that adapts to your appâ€™s light or dark mode settings. This ensures that your map view matches the appâ€™s overall theme seamlessly, improving visual consistency and reducing eye strain during night or daytime navigation.


## Grouped Tags

To streamline the [Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#details), all POI tags and translations are now consolidated under a single item. This grouping includes fields such as:

- `name`
- `alt name`
- `old name`

This makes it easier to find relevant information about points of interest without unnecessary clutter.

<!--
## Nearby Areas

*Map context menu â†’ Details â†’ Within*

![Within iOS](./img/within_ios.png)

OsmAnd has enhanced **Polygon Information**, making geographic data even more accessible. From the [Map Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu/#details), you can view nearby polygons with detailed attributes.  

*How it works:*

- *Long tap* on the map
- *Single tap* on a POI

Youâ€™ll see information like polygon type, name, and a size-based sorting from smallest to largest. Whether exploring administrative boundaries or geographic features, this feature ensures you get all the essential details at a glance.

-->

## Profile Appearance Redesign

The [profile appearance](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles/#my-location-appearance) has been redesigned for better usability and visual appeal.

*Key updates*:

- *Customization tools*. New icon and color selection options for profiles.
- *Map redesign*. Improved interface for selecting location icons on the map.
- *Default 3D icons*. Modernized design elements for a fresh look. 
- *Additional visual elements* for the Resting and Navigation positions below my location icon:
  - **View angle**. Displays a cone-shaped area that shows the direction you are currently facing.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.

  - **Location radius**. Shows a circular area around your icon, representing the accuracy of your current location.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  


##  Quick Action Updates

### Location Position on Screen

*Menu â†’ Configure screen â†’ Custom buttons â†’ + â†’ Add button â†’ Add action â†’ Settings â†’ Location position on screen*

![Widget page](./img/conf_screen_display_position_ios.png)

A new Quick Action button allows changing the [Location position on screen](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#settings). You can enable or disable the display of the previously selected *My Location* cursor position on the map.


### Switch Between Terrain Styles

In this release, we have added the ability to switch between terrain color palettes, similar to switching between layers. This can be done using the Quick Actions tool.  

How to set it up:  
*Menu â†’ Configure screen â†’ Custom buttons â†’ + â†’ Add button â†’ Add action â†’ Configure map â†’ Terrain color scheme*

### Touch Screen Lock

*Menu â†’ Configure screen â†’ Custom buttons â†’ + â†’ Add action â†’ Interface â†’ Lock screen*

![Lock screen](./img/lock_screen_ios.png)

We've added an incredibly useful new [Touch Screen Lock](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#touch-screen-lock)  option to the Quick Actions menu that helps you easily lock and unlock the map interface.
