Hello everybody!!!

In the latest release of OsmAnd Android 4.5.6 we have created a special plan for our dear users - ***OsmAnd Start***. 
What does it mean?  

- It is an opportunity to use OsmAnd Cloud absolutely FREE of charge.
- You can take advantage of free cloud backup of your Favorites, Settings, and OSM edits/notes. (_<u>Cloud storage 5 MB</u>_).
- This plan will soon be available for the iOS version of OsmAnd as well.

   &#9755;  Let's go!

   _OsmAnd App Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud → ⚙️ (Back up settings) → Storage taken (Back up data)_
