## External sensors

The release introduces support for [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors), providing compatibility for a range of external sensors such as speed, cadence, distance, temperature and pulse. This inclusion enhances the app’s capability to sync and display data from these external devices, catering to cycling enthusiasts and those using supplementary fitness equipment.   

|Sensor connection| Widget on the screen|
|-------|------|
|![Sensor](./img/sensor_1.png)|![Sensor](./img/sensor_2.png)|
You can add the following external sensors to the OsmAnd application:
- **Heart Rate**. The heart rate sensor can transmit your heart rate in real time. This is useful for cycling training when you want to track your heart rate to optimize your training efforts.
- **Bicycle Cadence**. Cadence is the number of pedal turns per minute. Cadence sensors help you maintain optimal pedalling speed for efficient cycling.
- **Bicycle Speed**. Speed sensors provide information about your current speed while cycling.
- **Bicycle Distance**. Distance sensors measure the distance you travel when you're driving.
- **Temperature**. The widget displays the ambient temperature, which can be very useful if you don't want to overheat or freeze on your bike or motorcycle.

This data from external sensors can be added for a [recording track](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors/#trip-recording) or to the [Widget panel](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets/#external-sensors-widgets). This data you can see on [_Analyze Track on the map_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map#analyze-track-on-map).

## New Help screen

This is an important new feature for users who often travel in regions with limited internet access. The application now has an offline (saved to cache) help screen that helps you solve questions and find information without a network connection.

_Menu → Help_

In addition, the _Help_ menu has been completely redesigned, adding articles from [www.osmand.net/docs](https://osmand.net/docs/intro) with additional menu sections:

_Most viewed, User guide, Troubleshooting, Contact us, Report issues, About OsmAnd_.

## CarPlay dashboard support and 3D

One of the additions in this update is the integration of the OsmAnd map into the CarPlay dashboard.  
- Added dashboard support.
- Added 3D button to the CarPlay screen.
- Fixed bugs.

## Share point coordinates by an OSM link

Now in [the Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu/#coordinates) of a point, you can find not only geographical coordinates in various formats but also a shareable OpenStreetMap Link with a location marker.

## More

### GPX slope color

Palitra for Slope ([Track Appearance](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map#track-appearance)) is symmetric. The reasoning is that in plenty of use cases like hiking, biking, trail running, and skiing, descents are of equal significance than ascents, there is no reason to compress the color space of one vs. the other.

|Track Appearance menu| Track on the map|
|----|----|
|![Slope color](./img/slope_0.png)|![Slope color](./img/slope_1.png)|

### Rename Route parameters

For [_Cycling_ and _On foot_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/routing/bicycle-based-routing#route-parameters---bicycle) routing we renamed "_Use elevation data_" to "_Preferred terrain_":
- _Menu → Configure profile (Boat, Driving, Walking or another one) → Navigation settings → Route parameters → Preferred terrain → Any, Flat, Less hilly, Hilly_
- _Navigation button → Settings → Preferred terrain → Any, Flat, Less hilly, Hilly_

![Preferred terrain](./img/routing.png)

### Info for navigaton route

Additional info was added for Navigaton screen:
- Altitude range (Max/Min altitude)
- [CO2 emission](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/navigation-settings#fuel-used-by-motor) (Vehicle engine type is provided)

![Route info](./img/route_info.png)

### Share point coordinates by an OSM link

Now in [the Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu/#coordinates) of a point, you can find not only geographical coordinates in various formats, but also a shareable OpenStreetMap Link with location marker.
