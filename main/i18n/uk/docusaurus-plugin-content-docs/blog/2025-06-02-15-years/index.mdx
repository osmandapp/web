## 🎉 OsmAnd Turns 15

This June 2, OsmAnd celebrates its **15th birthday**.

Fifteen years ago, we set out to build a navigation app powered by open data, built for travelers, mappers, and explorers — and committed to offline freedom and user privacy.

<!--truncate-->

Today, OsmAnd is used by **millions of people around the world**. From hiking remote trails to mapping unmapped towns, you've shown what’s possible when people are empowered by open-source tools.

I want to personally thank every one of you — users, contributors, translators, testers, developers, and supporters. You've helped us grow OsmAnd into what it is today.  

Let’s keep building, mapping, exploring — together.  
**Here’s to 15 years of OsmAnd — and to the road ahead.**

— **Victor**,  
Co-founder of OsmAnd
