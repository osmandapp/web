Also, there will be no information about periods at rest, like breaks. This has effects on any analysis or post-processing, like when trying to determine the total length of your trip, time in motion, or your average speed.",
  "monitoring_min_speed_descr_recommendation": "Recommendation: Try using the motion detection via the \"logging minimum displacement\" filter (B) first, it may produce better results, and you will lose less data. If your tracks remain noisy at low speeds, try non-zero values here. Please note that some measurements may not report any speed value at all (some network-based methods), in which case you would not record anything.",
  "monitoring_min_speed_descr_remark": "Remark: \"speed > 0\" check: Most GPS chipsets report a speed value only if the algorithm determines you are in motion, and none if you are not. Hence using the \"> 0\" setting in this filter in a sense uses the motion detection of the GPS chipset. But even if not filtered here at recording time, we still use this feature in our GPX analysis to determine the \"Distance corrected\", i.e. the value displayed in that field is the \"distance recorded while in motion\".",
  "monitoring_min_accuracy_descr": "This will record only points measured with a minimum \"accuracy\" indication (in meters/feet, as reported by Android for your chipset). Accuracy is the proximity of measurements to the true position, and is not directly related to precision, which is the scatter of repeated measurements.",
  "monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_side_effect": "Side effect: As a result of filtering by accuracy, points may be entirely missing for e.g. below bridges, under trees, between high buildings, or with certain weather conditions.",
  "monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_recommendation": "Recommendation: It is hard to predict what will be recorded and what not, it may be best to turn this filter off.",
  "monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_remark": "Remark: If GPS had been off immediately before a recording, the first point measured may have a decreased accuracy,so in our code we may want to wait a second or so before recording a point (or record the best of 3 consecutive points, etc.), but this is not yet implemented.",
  "monitoring_min_distance_descr": "Turning this filter on allows you to avoid additional data recording when movement is almost not detected. It also improves the spatial appearance of tracks without further processing.",
  "monitoring_min_distance_descr_side_effect": "Side effects: Periods of rest are not recorded at all or just as one point each. Minor movements (for example, to the side of the road to mark a possible turn in your trip) can be filtered out. Note that your file will contain less information for post-processing, and at the same time can potentially save GPS artifacts caused by bad reception or chipset effects.",
