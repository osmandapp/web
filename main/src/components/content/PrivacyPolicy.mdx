Personalized data is understood as the information may includes the data that identifies or describes a user or another identifiable individual.

## 3. The information the Company collects

**3.1** Company aggregates non-personal data that cannot identify a user. Such data includes the apps' installs, the frequency of the launches, the devices' models, software versions, the countries where the application is used, the language, and downloaded maps info. Also, the users may be asked to leave an email to get access to certain additional features and to participate in marketing activities, and provide non-personalized data about the use of different screens in the application without any user input data to let the Company improve certain functionality.

**3.1.1** Info about downloaded maps helps to learn the region's popularity to provide the best service where it is most used. It's important to provide maps as fast as possible for users who have just installed the app or need them urgently, in contrast to regular batch updates.

- The map download data is tied to the [UUID (Unique User Identifier)](https://osmand.net/docs/legal/terms-of-use#6-unique-user-indentifier) and contains the IP address that was used to download maps, the date and time when it was downloaded, and the list of downloaded regions.
- OsmAnd doesn’t collect any data if the map was installed manually.

**3.1.2** Info about opened screens is disabled by default. By enabling it, you are sharing:

- List of names of screens (features) without any user content/user input data. For example, you share that you used the search feature, but never share what you were searching for.  
- Screen data is tied to the UUID (Unique User Identifier).

**3.1.3** You can always control what data to share in [the General settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/global-settings#privacy-and-security) of the OsmAnd app.

**3.2** Collected data may be used for reports and statistics as well as for the OsmAnd discount pop-up notifications, according to this Privacy Policy. Collected data is never shared with a third party.

**3.3** We strongly believe in the principle of data protection and safety; thus, the Company does not collect, store, process, or transfer any personal information of users besides the cases when such information is provided by the users with their clear consent.  

**3.4** When making purchases through the OsmAnd website (osmand.net), payment processing is handled by our authorized reseller, **FastSpring (Bright Market, LLC)**. FastSpring acts as the **data controller** for all personal and payment data submitted during the checkout process. The data collected may include your name, email address, billing address, IP address, payment details, and purchased product information. This data is used exclusively for processing your order, managing invoices and subscriptions, and delivering digital content. FastSpring may transfer data to servers outside the EU (e.g., in the United States) with appropriate safeguards, such as [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://fastspring.com/privacy/#data-transfer).

It is also possible in case of investigations, including those concerning possible fraud, terms of use infringement, or other cases that are potentially harmful to the Company. Besides that, data can be shared or disclosed to prevent harm or damage to the users.  

**3.6** If the Company faces reformation such as acquisition by another business, company merger, or other, the information collected by the Company can be transferred to the relevant parties.
