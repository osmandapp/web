  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="change_maps_dir">How to move OsmAnd's home (maps) folder to the external SD card? (for Android version only)</div>
    <div class="content">
      In order to move the OsmAnd home (maps) folder to an external SD card:
      <ul class="list">
        <li> Go to Settings (on the start screen)-> OsmAnd Settings-> <a href="https://osmand.net/features/start#Setting_OsmAnd_for_your_region_android">Data storage folder (for Android version only)</a>.</li>
        <li> Change the value to a path pointing to the external SD card, on many Android systems it may contain "/storage/extSdCard" or similar. Please note that some versions of Android strictly limit your choice of which path will be write-accessible for apps.</li>
        <li> Then you can move the contents of OsmAnd's data folder from the internal memory to the external SD card , either using the built-in "move" option the OsmAnd app provides when changng the data folder, or using a built-in file manager app on the device, or via connecting the device to a computer as external storage and performing the move from there.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="failed_to_use_sdcard_on_4_4">How do I use my SD card with OsmAnd under Android 4.4+ and 5?</div>
    <div class="content">
      If you update your Android to version 4.4.x, you will experience a known Android issue with the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission: Android has changed the rules so that from now on no application can write to the external SD card anywhere outside its new standard folder <span class="code">Android/data/[PACKAGE-NAME]</span>. If OsmAnd was installed prior to updating your device to Android 4.4.x, it will continue to work (read-only) with the old, non-standard <span class="code">osmand</span> folder, but won't be able to update any map and other files there.
      <p>Solutions:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><u>Move OsmAnd's data folder <span class="code">osmand</span> to the internal storage.</u>
          <br/> <b>Drawback:</b> Internal storage can be rather small.
        </li>
        <li><u>Move OsmAnd's data folder <span class="code">osmand</span> into its standard SD folder</u>,
          <br/>for OsmAnd+ : <span class="code">(extSdCard)/Android/data/net.osmand.plus<wbr>/files</span>
          <br/>for OsmAnd : <span class="code">(extSdCard)/Android/data/net.osmand/files</span>
          <br/> <b>Caution:</b> Whenever you uninstall OsmAnd now, all your data will be erased as well! (Unless you unmount your SD card, or rename the <span class="code">net.osmand(.plus)</span> folder before de-installation.)
      </ul>
      If you manually want to perform the necessary copies/moves, either use a PC to perform this action on the SD card, or via the device itself using the file manager tool <b>which came pre-installed with your Android</b> (only these methods will have the necessary write permission).
      Copies can also be invoked in OsmAnd itself via Menu/Settings/General/Data storage folder but the copy operations may take a long time or result in errors (e.g. if the SD card is too full).
      <p>You might experience an issue with the new OsmAnd version working with Android 5 devices. It is known and we&#8217;re working to fix it as soon as possible. Please read more <a href="https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1838">on GitHub</a>. OsmAnd doesn&#8217;t ask specific permissions to get access to random folder on device, though we expect that the standard path on the SD card (Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files/osmand) should work. You can try to enter the path manually in order to make it work.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="osmand_installation_failed">OsmAnd+ installation on the SD card fails</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This happens only for the OsmAnd+ paid version and it is a known Google Play issue (this is reproducible for other paid applications copied to SD card). </p>
      <p>Symptoms: <u>Application was installed on SD card and update fails</u></p>
      <p>Possible solution:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Check here http://www.newbiehelper.net/solve-couldnt-install-on-usb-storage-or-sd-card-error-in-android-2-2/</li>
        <li> If you have a running application, please make a backup</li>
        <li> Export your favorites and then uninstall the application completely </li>
        <li> Clear the cache of Google Play app and unmount the SD card</li>
        <li> Re-install the app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because this issue happens before the OsmAnd app even starts, this issue cannot be fixed in OsmAnd, but needs to be fixed by Google Play. Please turn to Google Play &#8212; Help &#8212; Contact Us and report the issue there so Google can fix it. (The issue happens only for some devices and Android versions.) </p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="reset_without_data_loss">Uninstalling or Resetting OsmAnd without Losing Your Data</div>
    <div class="content">
      Please note that most versions of Android also remove an app's data folder when you uninstall an app (or when in Android's App manager settings you tap 'Clear data' to reset the app settings to default). If no precaution is taken, this will for OsmAnd mean you <b>lose all downloaded maps as well as any stored Favorites, GPX tracks, etc.(!)</b>
      <p>
      On most systems the following procedure can be used to reset or uninstall/reinstall OsmAnd while preserving the original app data on the SD card:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Before any Uninstall or Clear data operation, <b>rename the app data folder</b>, e.g. from <i>net.osmand.plus</i> to <i>net.osmand.plus0</i></li>
        <li>Then either in the Android App manager force stop / clear cache / clear data to reset the app, or uninstall/reinstall OsmAnd, as desired</li>
        <li>Start OsmAnd</li>
        <li>On its 'First Start' screen tap: Get started -> Change the data folder to the SD card -> Skip -> Skip downloading maps</li>
        <li>Force-stop OsmAnd</li>
        <li>Using a file manager app, delete the newly created (almost empty) OsmAnd data folder, and rename your old (preserved) data folder back</li>
        <li>Restart OsmAnd</li>
        <li>Go to Settings / Download maps: Your existing offline maps should now be listed on tab Local. Go to the tab Update and tap the refresh icon, this should make OsmAnd finally aware maps are already present and can be used.</li>

  <div class="question">

      <ul class="list">
        <li>You can <a href="https://osmand.net/features/trip-planning#Planning_trip_using_GPX_track">download and open it</a> via File Browser or Dropbox and select OsmAnd as a target application</li>

          <li> You need to download the contour line files from the menu in Settings &#8212; Manage map files. Select the country or region you want to download contour lines for and tap the download icon next to "Contour lines". You can also download hillshade data ("Hillshades") to make hills and mountains stand out even more. </li>
          <li> Check at what zoom level they appear in Menu &#8212; Configure map &#8212; Show contour lines. </li>
          <li> If you additionally have hillshade layer data present, its display can independently be enabled in Menu &#8212; Configure map &#8212; Hillshade layer. </li>

        <li>If <a href="https://osmand.net/features/contour-lines-plugin#How_to_use_it_I">the contour lines</a> do not show up, please follow these steps:</li>
        <li>Check if the Contour Maps plugin is enabled under Maps &#38; Resources — Plugins — Contour Lines. If you haven't purchased the plugin, you have to do it first.</li>
        <li>Next you have to download the contour line files of the areas you need. To do it, please go to Maps &#38; Resources and choose country. On that page, you'll see contour lines and hillshade downloads close to the main map file.</li>
        <li>Then just go to the map and zoom in until you see the lines. If you need hillshade as well, just download the hillshade file, then tap the map button on the left and turn Hillshade switcher on.</li>

    <div class="subtitle" id="countour_lines_feet">Is there a way to have contour lines displayed in feet also, instead of meters?</div>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="installation_issue">I can't install or upgrade the app</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you have an error "-25/-26/-27" please read below, otherwise please contact support.
        The issue you are experiencing is now confirmed as Xiaomi MIUI's integrated anti-virus' fault. To avoid error "-25/-26/-27", you need to freeze the "Guard Provider" process before updating OsmAnd. Then, once updated, you can re-enable the process. There are many ways and tools to freeze a process. We suggest you to google it yourself, although some of our users used 3C Toolbox or App Master, but we leave this to your preference.
      </p>
      <p>To freeze a process, follow these steps: go to App Manager --> Apps tab --> filter by System Apps --> select the "Guard Provider" --> tap the Manage button (bottom right, four little squares) --> Freeze.
        To unfreeze, repeat the same procedure. Unfortunately "App Master" does not do freeze in the OsmAnd Free version. 3C Toolbox does the trick, but you will find the "Guard Provider" process as "com.securitycore.miui_t" under "Apps" with the filter on "System".

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="uninstall_issue">I can't uninstall the app</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Sometimes you might want to uninstall the app because you want to install the paid version or a nightly develompment build, and you find that the "UNINSTALL" option is inactive.
      This is because OsmAnd has been configured as "Device Manager" by you as user.<br>
      In hiking/cycling mode OsmAnd can be configured to switch off the screen and switch it on just before a navigational change of direction is necessary.
      To make this possible in Android, OsmAnd is added to the "Device administrators" section. This is the reason you can't uninstall OsmAnd.
      </p>
      <p>To uninstall OsmAnd in such a case you need to go to (Android) "Settings->Security->device administrators" and uncheck OsmAnd as a device administrator.
      After having done that you can uninstall OsmAnd. </p>

    <div class="subtitle" id="routing_slow">Route calculation is slow</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Please be aware that there are 2 offline routing engines in the app: a Java based approach and a "Native" (C++) routing. The Java based approach is used in 'Safe Mode', it is 10 times slower than native mode and it has strict memory limitations. If you experience it and you see messages 'Not enough memory to compute', please go to Settings &#8212; 'General' &#8212; 'Safe mode' and make sure the option is disabled.</p>
      <p>For native routing there are different limitations for different phones, depending on memory &amp; processor. In general, native routing should handle &lt; 300 km routes nicely. The route calculation should take between 15 sec and 4 minutes. It is prudent to not wait much longer than 4 minutes, because most likely the program will crash. </p>
      <p>The only known workaround to compute long routes is to insert intermediate destinations. Two additional intermediate destinations should be enough even for very long routes.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="long_route">How to calculate routes longer than 250km?</div>
    <div class="content">
      Many long routes (> 200-250km) cannot not be calculated by OsmAnd's offline routing engine today. If the app does not show a route after 7-8 minutes of calculation time, consider <a href="https://osmand.net/features/navigation#Navigation_services">placing waypoints</a> (pick e.g. places on motorways). 3-4 waypoints will be enough to calculate even 1000km routes.

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="tts_vs_recorded">What is the difference between TTS (text to speech) and recorded voices?</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>TTS (text to speech) synthesizes any voice prompt just from a specified text "on the fly", while recorded voices depend on combining every command from a set of snippets pre-recorded from a human voice.</p>
      <p>In OsmAnd, we recommend using a synthesized (TTS) voice. They are better maintained by the project developers to provide the latest feature set. Since they are more flexible, they are e.g. able to also pronounce street names or highway numbers (OsmAnd version 1.5.1 and newer), which pre-recorded voices can not. TTS prompts may on some devices sound a bit more "robotic", and the selection of languages actually supported on your device is more limited. Both what languages are supported and their voice quality strictly depend on the TTS engine installed on your device, not on OsmAnd. See also next section "TTS does not function properly".</p>
      <p>I suggest that recorded voices should only be a fallback if you <b>really</b> like a particular voice, or if you cannot find a TTS engine supporting your language. Many 'recorded' voices have significant shortcomings like gaps and unnatural intonation, and some phrases may be missing entirely, where for a maintenance like adding new commands we could not get access to the original speakers any more.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="tts_not_working">TTS does not function properly</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>TTS issues will usually have to be fixed in your <b>Android configuration and settings</b>, not within the OsmAnd app!</p>
      <p>Which TTS languages are supported on your device and the sound quality of each TTS voice strictly depends on the TTS engine you select (or install) via your <b>Android device settings</b>. There is usually one TTS engine pre-installed on each device (e.g. google, Samsung, Pico). An additional 3rd party engine (see below) can be installed if needed.
      <p>
      <p>A TTS engine often supports several languages, but one needs to be selected as the one to be used. To improve the voice quality: Some TTS engines come pre-installed with only a set of basic-quality pronunciation packages for the languages they support, and then faciliate downloading a high-quality package for the very language you actually select to be used.</p>
      <p>If you have issues with the TTS voice guidance:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>First check if you have a TTS engine installed on your Android device which supports the language you want (i.e. offers it for selection in its options). To do this, find and select the language you want in the <u>Android (not OsmAnd) settings</u>, often located under "Language and Input / Text-to-speech options".</li>
        <li>Then use the test button usually provided there to "Listen to an example". You should hear a test annnouncement in the correct language and pronunciation.</li>
        <li>Once this works, finally go to OsmAnd's General settings / Voice guidance and there select the corresponding TTS language (it should be the same language or at least same language family you tested above). (Please note that the language list OsmAnd initially displays can be extended by tapping the "Install more..." option.)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>It is a known issue that many pre-installed TTS engines may not support less widely spoken languages (even though the number of languages supported is growing). You can always try to find a 3rd party TTS engine supporting the language you are looking for: Install it on your device, and follow the above procedure. This should then provide TTS support for this language. Some of the more prominent TTS engines are:

      <ul>
        <li> Go to Search (on the start screen)</li>

      Please keep in mind that OsmAnd data is based on the data from OpenStreetMap. This global map is built collaboratively by Internet users. In some cases the data is not complete. If you cannot find the postcode you need, it does not always mean that the postcode is wrong. Maybe just nobody added it to the map.

      Firstly, OsmAnd is meant to support OpenStreetMap and tries to go that path as far as possible. Secondly, there are licensing issues. Although OsmAnd cannot be distributed with Google Maps data, you can, however, add the tile source manually, if you know the tile source URL.

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="speed_cameras">OsmAnd shows only some speed camera traps</div>
    <div class="content">
      Due to the geodata taken from the OpenStreetMap project there are by now two methods how speed cameras are integrated in the raw OSM data:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A point (called "node" in OSM terminology) of a way is tagged with "highway=speed_camera"), see OSM wiki at <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag%3Ahighway%3Dspeed_camera">highway=speed_camera</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          a group of OSM data elements are joined together in a so called "relation" that contains more elements than a single node to describe the direction that is covered by the speed trap ... see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:enforcement">Relation:enforcement</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Currently, OsmAnd can only make use of the elements that consists of a single node. Analyzing of relations is to come in a future release.

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="drain_too_much_power">OsmAnd seems to drain too much battery power</div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>There have on and off been user reports about this. We made lots of measurements and could never really reproduce it, even though under some circumstances OsmAnd is reported responsible for 90% of the battery usage. Please be aware that OsmAnd does not run anything in background except its Sleep mode (background service), and this needs to be specifically enabled (via OsmAnd's GPX recording or Navigation guidance functionality). If enabled, you will always see the OsmAnd sleep mode icon in the status bar (can also be stopped there). So unless the sleep mode is active, if you exit the app (go to home screen), OsmAnd will will not cause any power consumption.</p>
    <p>Power usage issues were reported with Android 2.3 and Android 4.0. In Android 4.0 you can double-check details of what causes how much battery drain. If you check CPU time / screen time / GPS time consumed by OsmAnd (in Android's standard power manager) you will see that the numbers don't add up correctly. For example, 2 min GPS, 2 min CPU, 1 min Screen causes 30% consumption. If you have some better good evidence, please contact us.</p>
    <p>PS: If you use OsmAnd for hiking or otherwise carry your device in a loose pocket where you might press the device's power switch accidentally, it is also advisable to put OsmAnd to the background (by hitting the device's Home button), before putting the device to sleep. Reason: If OsmAnd's map screen is the foreground application, any accidental (unnoticed) push on the power button will not only activate the screen briefly (this is unavoidable), but may then <u>also</u> briefly activate GPS, which is quite a battery eater.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="trip_recording_stops">Trip recording stops while screen is off</div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>If you experience this, first of all check if not the corresponding setting 'Prevent standalone logging' is active in OsmAnd's settings under Plugin/Trip recording.</p>
    <p>Secondly, update OsmAnd to 3.4 or higher. Different Android versions apply different strategies to reduce power consumption <a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/">by killing apps running in the background</a>. New versions of Android therefore deploy a Foreground service while recording a trip, visible in the Android notification bar, in an effort to keep the app active.</p>

    <p>If you still experience issues, you may want to try these measures:</p>
  <ul>
       <li>In your <b>Android's</b> Power or Power Savings setting, white-list OsmAnd to not being optimized</li>
       <li>In <b>Android's</b> 'Apps', 'Applications', or 'App Manager' settings, find OsmAnd and tap it. You may find a line item regarding 'Power Savings' or 'Power Consumption': Tap it and exempt OsmAnd from power optimization measures.</li>
       <li>If this fails, you may want to disable Power Saving on the device globally to see if your issues are caused by it at all</li>
  </ul>

      <p><b>Update Android 9 and 10, Hardy, 2020-08-25:</b> I have successfully tested the following Power saving settings under Android 9 and 10 (on Samsung devices), with particular attention if OsmAnd logging works reliably:</p>

      <h4 class="help">How can I contribute a new language TTS voice file? </h4>
      The TTS voice files (ttsconfig.p) are stored here  <a href="https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice">Github voice</a>. You can fork the repository and then create a pull request with your file.
      <ul>
        <li> Please do not use an underscore _ at the beginning of your file name.</li>
        <li> Do not change the version number specified in the ttsconfig.p file. Use the same number as in the ttsconfig.p file you start cloning from. This number does not denote a file version, but rather the API version that the TTS uses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please refer to our English en-tts file for basic reference and as template, and consider to look at grammatically more complex languages like German (de-tts), Czech (cz-tts), or Slovak (sk-tts) to cover more complex statements. There should be a way to correctly produce what needs to be done - the PROLOG used in the tts-config.p files is a powerful programming language.</p>
      <p>Regarding distribution: In the latest versions the tts voices are distributed within the app (apk) and need not / cannot be downloaded any more via the download server on the web. (Don't be confused, they still appear like downloads in the app's Offline Data Manager, but they are listed there only and contained locally). The basic idea is that TTS files will not be updated too frequently, so in general it is sufficient to have them distributed with each release, within the application.</p>

      <h4 class="help">OsmAndMapCreator fails with message: OutOfMemoryError </h4>
      <p>The file you try to process with OsmAndMapCreator is too large. Either try to process a smaller file, or increase the memory for OsmAndMapCreator in the .sh or .bat file. The -Xmx parameter specifies how much memory the program can consume. Settings can be different for 64bit (more than 1.5GB) and 32bit (max around 1.5GB) machines.</p>
      <h4 class="help">After converting an .osm to .obf with only a POI index, the .obf is empty, although original .osm file did contain POIs. What is wrong? </h4>
      <p>It could be that a crucial tag was missing for OsmAndMapCreator to recognize a POI when you converted the osm from another source, like Garmin. If a point in the OSM file looks like this:</p>
      <xmp>
        <node id='-24' visible='true' lat='1.3094000' lon='103.7784000'>
          <tag k='created_by' v='GPSBabel-1.4.2'/>
          <tag k='name' v='Street-Soccer Court'/>
        </node>
      </xmp>
      <p>change it to contain an additional 'amenity' tag, like:</p>
      <xmp>
        <node id='-24' visible='true' lat='1.3094000' lon='103.7784000'>
          <tag k='created_by' v='GPSBabel-1.4.2'/>
          <tag k='name' v='Street-Soccer Court'/>
          <tag k='amenity' v='point' />
        </node>
      </xmp>
      <p>Then convert the file using OsmAndMapCreator. You can check on the OSM site what tags are good ones to use, or you can just use this amenity.</p>
      <h4 class="help" id="">How can I specify internet access proxy settings for OsmAndMapCreator?</h4>
      <p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120797/how-do-i-set-the-proxy-to-be-used-by-the-jvm">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120797/how-do-i-set-the-proxy-to-be-used-by-the-jvm</a>
      Use OsmAndMapCreator.bat or OsmAndMapCreator.sh to start OsmAndMapCreator based on your operating system. Both of them invoke java, so you just need to add the -D... -D.. (i .e. -Djava.util.logging.config.file = logging.properties) params to the invocation.
      like:</p>
      <xmp>
        javaw.exe -Xms64M -Xmx720M -cp "./OsmAndMapCreator.jar;./lib/*.jar" net.osmand.swing.OsmExtractionUI
      </xmp>
      <p>after:</p>
      <xmp>
        javaw.exe -Dhttp.proxyHost=10.0.0.100 -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Xms64M -Xmx720M -cp "./OsmAndMapCreator.jar;./lib/*.jar" net.osmand.swing.OsmExtractionUI
      </xmp>
      <h4 class="help" id="">I want to put some custom details on a vector map (render own custom data)</h4>
      <p>OsmAndMapCreator can process only OSM files (osm-xml, bz2, pbf). However the set of tags can be customized. To specify what tags/values need to be indexed by Creator please download and change this file https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-core/blob/master/OsmAnd-java/src/net/osmand/osm/rendering_types.xml. OsmAndMapCreator has an option to use custom rendering_types.xml in the settings. Once the map file is created you can double check that data is present via the binaryInspector utility with the '-vmap' argument. This utility is packaged with OsmAndMapCreator.</p>
      <p>Once the .obf file is ready you can create a custom rendering file to display your custom missing attributes. There is a default rendering style which contains all information about rendering https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/rendering_styles<wbr>/default.render.xml. It is good to have a look at it but it is rather hard to understand, open, and edit it. A more convenient way to create your own rendering style is to create a style that depends on (inherits from) the default style.  A good example of a custom 'depends' rendering style is https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/rendering_styles/Winter-and-ski.render.xml.</p>
      <p>Currently OsmAndMapCreator doesn't support relation tagging. So you need to manually copy all tags from relations (like route color) to way tags by script.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <div class="subtitle" id="beta_testing">OsmAnd Beta Testing</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Google Play Store provides the possibility to test beta versions of apps, which enables you to (temporarily) download and use the test version from the Google Play Store instead of the standard release version(s).<br>For OsmAnd this means that you can participate in testing the new OsmAnd free or the new OsmAnd+ paid versions. This enables you to use and test exciting new features. Of course, using a beta version also means that you might encounter bugs or app crashes.<br>The Google Play Store mechanism also supports the easy return to the standard version from the Google Play Store.</p>
      <h4 class="help" id="">Activating the test version </h4>
      <p>Register as tester for the OsmAnd free test version via the following Google Group:
      https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand
      Register for the OsmAnd+ paid test version via the following Google Group:
      <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand.plus/testing">Testing</a>
      (note: this is only possible if you are a registered user for the paid version)</p>
      <ul>
        <li> When you click the link to register, you will see a big blue or green panel advertising "Be a test user" (in your defined language).</li>
        <li> After clicking the "button" you will see the message "You are now a tester" with a green check-mark in front of it (and on repetitive actions it will show "You are a tester").</li>
        <li> Give Google some time to synchronize which can be anywhere between 10 seconds or 60 minutes.</li>
        <li> Now you can download the test version, either directly from the Google Play Store, or via your phone/tablet.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="help" id="">Returning to the standard Google Play Store OsmAnd version </h4>
      <p>Note that the same registration screen, after having registered, also has a link "Leave the test version".
      If, after some time, you want to use the current standard release version from the Google Play Store again, proceed as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Use the above link again (so you better make this a bookmark/favorite in your browser). The page will still inform "You are a tester"</li>
        <li> The page also contains the link "Leave the test version".</li>
        <li> Click that link to then see "You have left the test version"</li>
        <li> Manually uninstall the test version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.</li>
        <li> Manually (re)install the current version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Note</b>: Before changing to the test version, export your OsmAnd favorites. The new test version should simply continue using the favorites but as it is a beta version for testing, you never know.
