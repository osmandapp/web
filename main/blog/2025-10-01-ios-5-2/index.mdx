## Resizable Text in Distance Measurement Tool

You can now resize the text in [the Distance by tap tool](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/radius-ruler#distance-by-tap). Two variants are available: Normal and Large, making it easier to read distances on the map.

## Precision Grid for Aligning Map Buttons

A new precision grid has been added to help you align your map buttons more accurately.

## Temperature Units in General Settings

The temperature units selection has been moved to [General Settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#units--formats) for easier access:

_Menu â†’ Settings (Select Profile) â†’ General Settings â†’ Units & formats â†’ Temperature (Device settings, Celsius or Fahrenheit)_

## Altitude Units Setting

Users can now set [altitude units (meters or feet)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#units--formats) separately from distance units in the settings:

_Menu â†’ Settings (Select Profile) â†’ General Settings â†’ Units & formats â†’ Altitude (Meters or Feet)_

## New Marine Map Style

["Marine"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#marine) is a new nautical map style designed for maritime navigation. This style displays [light characteristics](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Lights), [sectorial lights](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Sectored_and_Directional_Lights), and other maritime features. The Map Configure menu after enabling "Marine" style has additional options for customization in the "Other map attributes" section.
