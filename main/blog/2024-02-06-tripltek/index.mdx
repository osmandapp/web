## Can’t beat this combo!

For the past six months, I've been utilizing the  [TRIPLTEK 9](https://www.tripltek.com/tripltek9) for my off-road ventures. Having been a loyal user of the OsmAnd application for over 13 years, I was pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of this device. Previously, I relied on my iPhone for navigation, but its screen became virtually unreadable in bright sunlight.

With the release of  [OsmAnd 4.6](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-4-6-released), we introduced a special offer for [TRIPLTEK](https://www.tripltek.com/) - a complimentary annual promotional subscription. This offer allows every Tripltek owner to install the OsmAnd app and unlock Pro features (https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features). The Tripltek tablet itself is a robust, waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof device, boasting an ultra-bright display that ensures all map details remain visible even in sunny conditions. 

The integration of OsmAnd with [TRIPLTEK](https://www.tripltek.com/) tablets enhances the outdoor navigation experience significantly. Users can now enjoy the full suite of OsmAnd features on a ruggedized device tailor-made for outdoor adventures. This combination provides unparalleled reliability and usability, making it an invaluable tool for off-road enthusiasts, hikers, and explorers alike.
