## Widgets update

We are happy to inform you about the latest updates to the widgets in the app. 
We have made significant improvements and added new features that will make your user experience more informative and convenient.


### Updates for Top/Bottom panels

Our top and bottom panels have been redesigned with all our users' needs in mind. 
Now you can customize the widgets on your home screen the way you want, giving you more freedom to display important data.

**1.** Added ability to add and remove rows for *Top / Bottom panel*. 

_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Edit → [Add row](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#rows-for-panels)_

| View mode  | Edit mode   |
|-----|------|
| ![Row](./img/row.png)|![Row](./img/row_1.png)


**2.** Added support to change [widget size](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#settings). You can choose the size that best suits your needs: *Small, Medium, Large*.  

![Configure screen menu](@site/static/img/widgets/configure_screen_widgets_settings_2_andr.png)  

 
**3.** You can add more than one [Simple widget](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#rows-for-panels) in a single row.

### Glide Ratio Widgets

![Glide ratio](./img/glide_ratio.png)

Simple _[Glide Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio#Glide_ratio)_ widgets have been added for Aircraft usage. The widgets show the ratio of glide to target or average glide for the current flight.  

_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (All panels) → [Glide ratio to target](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets/#glide-ratio)_ and [_Average glide ratio_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets/#glide-ratio)

- _Glide ratio to target_ shows the glide ratio required to reach the target point. The [Map marker](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/markers) should be used as the target point.  
- _Average glide ratio_ shows the average glide ratio for a specified time interval. You can set the time interval for this widget from 15 seconds to 60 minutes.

|Glide ratio widgets| Widgets on the screen|
|--------|---------|
|![Glide ratio](./img/glide_ratio_1.png)|![Glide ratio](./img/glide_ratio_2.png)|

### Temperature widget

We have added a new widget for the [External sensor plugin](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors/#overview). **<Translate android="true" ids="external_device_characteristic_temperature"/>** widget displays the ambient temperature, which can be very useful if you don't want to overheat or freeze on your bike or motorcycle.  
- Read more about how to connect sensors to OsmAnd app [here](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors/#setup).  
- Next, you need [to add the temperature widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#external-sensors-widgets) to the OsmAnd screen:  
_Menu → Configure screen → [Any panels](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen.md#top--bottom-panel-widgets) → External sensors → Temperature_

|   |   |
|--------|---------|

_Menu → Configure screen → Left / Right panel → Sun position widget_

## Local menu redesign

When working with maps, additional resources are always important. Android 4.6 redesigns the *Local* tab in the *Maps & Resources* menu, making access to local maps and data more convenient and, with new graphs, more visual.  

The **Local** menu now contains all necessary additional information about the OsmAnd data:    
*Menu → Download maps (Maps & Resources) → Local*

- **Resources**: *Standard Maps, Terrain maps, Wikipedia and Travel maps, Nautical Maps, Weather, Map sources, Rendering styles, Routing, Cache*.
- **My Places**: *Favorites, Tracks, OSM Notes, OSM Edits, A/V Notes, Map markers, History, Itinerary*.
- **Settings**:
  - *Other*. Data that does not fit into other categories, such as logcat.
  - *Profiles*. All settings for created profiles and default profiles.

| Resources  | My places  |  Settings   |
|--------|---------|---------|
|![Local](./img/local.png)|![Local](./img/local_1.png)|![Local](./img/local_2.png)|  

You can select any item from the main list of categories on the Local tab, tap it, and go to a screen with a detailed list of that item and additional options.  

| Terrain maps  | Tracks  |
|--------|---------|
|![Local](./img/local_3.png)|![Local](./img/local_4.png)|


## Smart folders

The new [*Smart Folder*](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks#smart-folder) feature in the Tracks menu provides additional options for organizing tracks. This feature automatically sorts tracks according to the specified filter parameters and provides advanced settings to manage them.  

*Smart Folder* allows you to specify a set of parameters for GPX tracks to be contained in a folder, making it even easier to keep track of files.    
_OsmAnd menu → My Places → Tracks → &#8942; → Add smart folder_

| Tracks menu  | Settings  |
|--------|---------|
|![Smart folder](./img/smart_folder.png)|![Local](./img/smart_folder_1.png)|


## Filters for tracks

[Filter](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks#filter) for tracks can be used for tracks Search function and for Smart folders.  

- *OsmAnd menu → My Places → Tracks → 🔍 → Filter*
- *OsmAnd menu → My Places → Smart folder → Filter*  

![My places tracks](@site/static/img/personal/tracks/my_places_tracks_filter_andr.png)  

In addition to navigation and track creation, the Osmand app provides handy tools for managing your track recordings. With the latest update to the app, new features have been added to the Tracks section to better search and filter your tracks. These new filters provide more detailed and customizable options to search for tracks based on various parameters, allowing you to quickly find tracks that meet your specific requirements and preferences.   

**Filters**: *Duration, Time in motion, Length, Average speed, Uphill, Downhill, Average altitude, Max altitude, Date of creation, Nearest cities, Other*.

| Search menu | Filter menu |

|![Filter](./img/filter.png)|![Filter](./img/filter_1.png)|


## Trash feature in OsmAnd Cloud

A [Trash](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#trash) feature has been added for OsmAnd Cloud:  
*OsmAnd menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud → Trash*

With the *Trash* feature, you can easily view and restore files deleted from OsmAnd Cloud. This allows you to gain more control over your data and avoid accidental irreversible deletion.  

- *Empty trash* button deletes all items. 
- **Items in the trash will be erased after 30 days**.

| OsmAnd Cloud menu| Trash menu|
|-------|-------|
|![Trash](./img/trash.png)|![Trash](./img/trash_1.png)|

- Each item from Trash can be *Restore* or *Delete*. 

| Item's acitons|
|-------|
|![Trash](./img/trash_2.png)|


## New Help screen

This is an important new feature for users who often travel in regions with limited internet access. The application now has an offline (saved to cache) help screen that helps you solve questions and find information without a network connection.  

In addition, the Help menu has been completely redesigned, adding articles from [www.osmand.net/docs](https://osmand.net/docs/intro/) with additional menu sections:  

_OsmAnd Menu → Help_

_Most viewed_, [_User guide_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/), [_Troubleshooting_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/troubleshooting/), _Contact us_, _Report issues_, _About OsmAnd_.

## Redesign weather screen

The [Weather](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather) screen has been redesigned and improved, allowing users to get more accurate and up-to-date weather information on their route, such as a time scale. This is useful when planning trips and choosing the right time for outdoor activities.

|-------|
|![Weather](./img/weather.png)|


## Share point coordinates by an OSM link

Now you can customize actions for buttons or custom buttons for [External controllers](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#external-input-device-buttons). This allows you to customize the control of the application according to your preferences and makes it easier to use OsmAnd in different situations.

*Menu → Settings → Profiles → General settings → External input devices*

- Select external input devices, such as a _Keyboard_, and add _Key binding_.

## Update in Plan a route tool

Route planning has become even more convenient with an update. A new feature helps you create optimal routes for your trips.  

This is the *Import from Track* feature, which allows you to import waypoints, segments, and additional data from any other existing track into the current track. 

_[Plan a route](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plan-route/create-route) →  Options → Import from track_
