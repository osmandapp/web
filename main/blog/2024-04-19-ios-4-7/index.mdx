## Redesign Tracks menu

We've completely redesigned the [_Tracks menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks#my-places-menu) in [_My Places_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/myplaces). 

![My Places > Tracks menu iOS](./img/my_places_tracks_menu_ios.png) 

_Tracks on map_ folder now directly opens the [_Tracks menu_](#redesign-tracks-menu-of-configure-map) in Configure map.

By tapping the _3-dot_ button, you access a menu with the following actions:
- _Add folder_ allows you to create and name a new folder.
- _Import_ enables the importation of a GPX file.

![My Places > Tracks menu iOS](./img/my_places_tracks_menu_2_ios.png) 

_New track_ allows to start [_Trip recording_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording) action. Just click _"Start recording"_ button. During the recording, you can view the Recording track data, including distance, duration, and the number of waypoints. There are two key actions available during recording: _Stop record_ and _Save GPX track_.

## Redesign Tracks menu of Configure map

Enhanced management of tracks displayed on the map:

_iOS Menu → Configure map → Show on map → Tracks_

We've introduced two sections: _Visible_ and _All_

- In _Visible_, you can select and deselect tracks to be displayed on the map and choose from a "Recently Visible" section.
- In _All_, you have the option to select tracks from the complete track list.

![track menu iOS](./img/track_menu_ios.png) ![track menu iOS](./img/track_menu_2_ios.png)

- 📥 import a track from device.
- _"Select All"_ - select all tracks from the list.
- _"Done"_ - done your track selections and close the "Tracks" section.

By clicking on _"Last modified"_ you access the _Sort tracks_ menu. Here, you can organize your tracks by:
- _"Nearest"_ or _"Last modified"_
- _"Name A-Z"_ or _"Name Z-A"_
- _"Newest date first"_ or _"Oldest date first"_
- _"Longest distance first"_ or _"Shortest distance first"_
- _"Longest duration first"_ or _"Shorter duration first"_

## Sun position widget

A new [_Sun position_ widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#sun-position) has been added, complementing the Sunrise and Sunset widgets. This section of widgets is now named _"Sun position"_:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Add widget → Sun Position → Sun position, Sunrise, Sunset_. 

![Sun Position](./img/sun_position_3_ios.png)

_"Sun Position"_ widget displays the time until sunrise or sunset, based on the current time. This widget offers the following settings:

## Glide ratio widget

Simple [Glide Ratio widgets](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#glide-ratio) have been introduced for use in aircraft. These widgets display the glide ratio to the target or the average glide ratio for the current flight.

_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (All panels) → Glide ratio to target/Target elevation and Average glide ratio/Average vertical speed_

## Round up numbers in navigation widgets

You can now select the format for displaying distance information in navigation widgets, like distance to a point, the next turn, and lanes. Choose _"Precise"_ for exact figures or _"Round up"_ to enhance readability with simpler, rounded numbers:

_Menu → Settings → Navigation Profile → General settings → Units & formats → Distance during navigation → Precise or Round up_

![Round up iOS](./img/round_up_ios.png) ![Round up iOS](./img/round_up_1_ios.png)

## Vertical exaggeration

A special coefficient for [3D relief](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#3d-relief) has been added in this release. Now, you can adjust the Vertical Exaggeration:

 _iOS Menu → Configure map → Terrain → Vertical exaggeration_ (Ensure that 3D relief is enabled)

This feature allows you to view the contours of smoother topography with enhanced detail.

![Round up iOS](./img/vertical_exag.png)

## OsmAnd Cloud updates

- OsmAnd Cloud: added ability [to delete account](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#deletion-option).

## App Language for Basemap

The World Basemap now adopts the language of the app for naming, aligning with the app's language settings. This is applicable for base map zoom levels 1-6 (less than 7 map zoom). The app language can be modified in the System settings under _OsmAnd Maps – Language_. 

![App language](./img/app_language_ios.png) 

## Missing maps download

OsmAnd now alerts you if some maps between your start point and destination are missing. It's important to ensure that all maps are up to date and of the same release date for a consistent navigation experience.
