### Explore Winter Trails with OsmAnd’s Snowmobile Mode

When the landscape turns white and roads become snowy paths, OsmAnd is your perfect winter riding companion. With the [**Snowmobile map style**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#snowmobile), you can easily explore dedicated snowmobile routes right on the map — trails mapped as [`route=snowmobile`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:route%3Dsnowmobile) in OpenStreetMap appear clearly for winter recreation. [Simply tap](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/routes#actions-with-routes) on a visible [snowmobile route](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/routes#snowmobile-trails) to [start navigation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation#follow-track-options), and OsmAnd will guide you along it — even in areas with limited network coverage, thanks to offline maps.

To make your rides even more personalized, you can [**create your own snowmobile profile**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles). Choose an icon that fits your vehicle, set a distinctive color, and adjust navigation preferences such as speed display, routing type, or road avoidance. That way, every trip feels tailored to your snowmobile style — whether you’re on a short local ride or a cross-country expedition.
