One popular activity where technology plays a huge role is hiking. Hiking is a fun way to get your heart pumping and see stunning destinations. It is a wonderful activity for team building and exploration as you get to enjoy navigating with the help of a digital map.

<h1>Benefits of Using an Offline Map For Hiking</h1>

Offline maps are stored on your phone, so you can access them even if you don't have an internet connection. Of course, you can also opt to bring a printed map in case your gadget totally dies on you. This type of map comes in handy if you find yourself in an area with poor or no cell service. 

Keep in mind that extreme hikes usually mean you will be going off the beaten path, with little or no roads or trails to follow. This means that you'll get to see amazing scenery that few people have seen before, but if something goes wrong, there may be no one around to help you. The same goes for tourist hikes, where language barriers and unfamiliarity can cause unpredictable obstacles. That's why it's so important to have an <a href="https://osmand.net">offline map</a> with you!

Here are some more ways how offline maps could be a lifesaver when out on an extreme or tourist hike.

<strong>1. Accessibility</strong>

Using offline maps means that you can access them at any time, regardless of the signal reception in your area. This is extremely important as losing service while on a hike could be disastrous. Even if you are carrying a physical map, it's always a good idea to have a digital version as well. Plus, digital maps are usually more updated than printed ones and offer more features that will assist you in your navigation.

<strong>2. Extended Battery Life</strong>

When relying on technology for help, one of the first things that people worry about is battery life. An offline map can reduce your battery consumption since the map doesn't need to be constantly refreshed like when it is used online. Longer battery life will also give you extra peace of mind while on your hike because you will still be able to use your gadget to call for emergency assistance once you arrive at an area with good service.

<strong>3. Route Planning</strong>

With a printed or digital offline map, you can easily <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/routes">plan your route</a> before you set off on your hike. This way, you'll know where you're going and what to expect. If something does go wrong, you can simply refer to your map and find your way back to safety. Just make sure that you have downloaded the latest version of the map you need, as well as any updates, to ensure accuracy.

<strong>4. Shareability</strong>

Hikes are often done with a buddy or a group, and another lifesaving feature of an offline map is its shareability. This feature helps plan hikes and use points of interest <a href="https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/point-layers-on-map#points-of-interest-poi">(POI)</a> markers. These markers allow you to pin specific locations and add useful notes to them. By sharing these markers, everyone in your hike group will be aware of the exact areas that you can use as a meetup point if someone gets lost. You can also use these markers to share interesting locations with your group.

<strong>5. Customization</strong>

Most offline maps offer a wide range of customization options to make your hike planning easier. You can set the map according to your preferences, such as choosing the right map scale or adding more POI markers. Some maps also let you measure distance and area, which can come in handy when estimating how long it would take to hike a certain trail. This way, you can be sure to reach your campsite - or get back in time - before nightfall.

<strong>Final Word</strong>

The digital world has introduced a lot of practical technologies that can be used in all types of activities. For those who love to explore new landscapes, offline maps are easily available to help navigate the way. With these maps, you can rest assured that you'll always find your way even if your phone loses service. So next time you're heading out on a hike, make sure you download an offline map - or carry a printed map with you - just in case!
