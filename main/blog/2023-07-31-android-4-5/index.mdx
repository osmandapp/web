## Free account (Backup)

_OsmAnd Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud_

After that, you can [backup](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#select-data-to-back-up) your [favorites](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/favorites), [OSM Edits and Notes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/osm-editing#create--modify-osm-note), and [OsmAnd settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles) for free.

## Terrain maps updates

We have added _Terrain map_ for countries in [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) menu. This data type can be used to generate [Slopes, Hillshades (paid)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#free-and-paid-features), and 3D maps ([OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features)).

_OsmAnd menu → Download maps_

Our updates:
- [Slope](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#slope-map) and [Hillshades](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade-map) can be generated from _Terrain map_ data

![terrain](./img/terrain.png) ![terrain](./img/terrain_0.png)

- Redesigned [_Terrain menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu):

_OsmANd Menu → Configure Screen → Buttons → 3D Mode_:
- Hidden
- Visible
- VIsible in 3D mode
