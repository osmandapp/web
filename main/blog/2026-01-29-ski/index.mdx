## Winter & Ski Map Style Highlights  

The [**Winter and Ski map style**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#winter-and-ski) highlights ski pistes, routes, and lifts with clear colors and symbols, making it easy to study any resort layout at a glance.

 And even start [**navigation along that exact track**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation) (treated like a GPX file).

When setting start and finish points in the [**Skiing profile**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/routing/ski-routing), OsmAnd builds intelligent routes using ski pistes, descents, and lifts—perfect for complex multi-stage trips.

## Enhanced Slope Exploration  

For better terrain reading, enable [**3D relief**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography#3d-relief) alongside [**Avalanche coloring**](https://osmand.net/blog/avalanche) to visualize slope steepness and hazard zones clearly. Use the **[Ski map legend](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map-legend/ski-map)** to decode piste difficulties and route types.  

Some pistes show **night lighting** icons—enable **Street lighting** in **Configure map → Details** to see which slopes stay lit after dark.
