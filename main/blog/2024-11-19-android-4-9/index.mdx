## Vehicle Metrics

The new *Vehicle Metrics* plugin has been added to the [Plugins menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/), enabling the monitoring of key vehicle performance data using the [OBD-II protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). This plugin offers real-time metrics, such as engine speed, fuel consumption, and coolant temperature, with dedicated widgets for easy access to this data.  

Whether you are tracking fuel efficiency or ensuring engine health, the *Vehicle Metrics* plugin brings valuable insights directly to your device.

## GPX Track Activities

A new feature allows you to assign **Activity** types (such as hiking or cycling) to your recorded GPX tracks, enhancing track management and organization. You can now easily [filter tracks](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/smart-folder#available-filters) by activity, making it more convenient to organize and analyze your trips. This enhancement streamlines your experience by making sorting and accessing specific activities in your track history far more efficient.

## Customizable Map Buttons

Enhance your map screen with fully customizable [Quick Action and Default buttons](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#quick-action-button-appearance), including changes to icon, size, corner radius, and background opacity. Through the new grid layout, you can position buttons precisely for easy access.  

Button appearance settings can be adjusted via *Menu → Configure screen → Custom buttons* or *Default buttons → three-dot menu → Appearance*. Additionally, you can now export and import your custom button configurations, ensuring seamless transitions between devices.

## Widget Context Menu

The [Widget Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#panel-widgets-settings) allows you to manage and configure widgets directly from the map screen, providing *a quick way to organize panels*. You can access this menu by ***long tapping*** on any widget to customize the layout of widgets without leaving the map.

### Reset Average Speed

We have added a convenient [Reset average speed](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#average-speed) action directly in the widget context menu. With just a long tap on the widget, you can instantly reset the average speed value during your trip.  

This feature makes it easier to track real-time performance on the go without navigating through multiple menus, giving you more control over your trip statistics with minimal effort.

## Lock Screen Feature for Seamless Navigation

We have added a *Touch screen lock* feature, similar to Garmin devices, allowing you to lock your screen while navigating, preventing accidental taps. This update also brings new quick actions for trip recording and managing the visibility of OSM edits, enhancing your navigation experience.

[New quick actions](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#action-types):

- ***Lock/Unlock screen***. This option can be accessed using the Custom buttons:  
*Menu → Configure screen → Custom buttons →* + *→ Add acton →* **Inteface**.  

- ***Trip recording actions***. Start, pause, or finish your trip seamlessly:  
*Menu → Configure screen → Custom buttons →* + *→ Add acton →* **My Places**.

*Menu → Configure screen → Custom buttons →* + *→ Add acton →* **Configure Map** or **My Places**.

## Ride Like a Pro: Dirt Bike Trails Now Available

We are excited to introduced **Dirt bike trails** to improve your off-road adventures! Now you can activate colored overlays for dirt bike routes, based on the dirtbike, just like mountain biking routes.

- Find it in *Menu → Configure map → Routes → Dirt bike routes*.

## Discover Nearby Areas with OsmAnd Polygon Info

These updates enhance **Polygon Information** by making data about surrounding areas accessible from the [map context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#details) in OsmAnd.  

Now, after a long tap on the map or a single tap a POI, you can view detailed information on nearby polygons, including type and name, sorted by size from smallest to largest. This feature is helpful for quickly identifying geographic or administrative areas within your location.

*To access: Map context menu → Details → [Within](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#polygon-information)*.

<!--
## Interactive Access Points

When using OsmAnd, you can now interact with access-related icons such as *Barrier*, *Steps*, or *Gate* directly on the map. A simple tap on these icons will bring up detailed information, including the name of the POI, its type, and the address.  

This functionality enhances quick access to important navigation data for objects on your route, helping you understand restrictions or attributes of paths and roads at a glance. You can explore this via the [map context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#overview).

By tapping on icons for *Barrier*, *Steps*, or *Gate*, the context menu reveals additional details, including the name (POI type) and address associated with these features, or displays object type, if a name is not available.

## Introducing Hiking Trail Grades

We have renamed *Difficulty classification* to **Hiking Trails Difficulty Grade** for better clarity and ease of use.  

This feature highlights trail difficulty for mountain routes, using either the SAC or CAI scales, ensuring you are well-prepared for your adventure. Both systems help identify the necessary skills and equipment for safe travel.

Find the setting in *Configure map → Routes → [Hiking trails difficulty grade](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/routes#hiking-trails-difficulty-grade): SAC or CAI*.


## Custom Graph Display for GPX Tracks

We have enhanced the [graph toggle](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording#overview-screen) for recorded tracks, allowing you to select specific data types, such as heart rate or other available options, and display them directly on the graph.  

This update lets you select any available data on the Trip recording screen, making it easier to view critical information during or after your trip, improving your overall analysis of recorded GPX data.

## New Route Guidance Widgets (Beta)

We are excited to introduce a new set of route guidance widgets to the [Top/Bottom widget panels](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#top-and-bottom-panels) in OsmAnd's *Configure screen menu*. These widgets give you real-time navigation information, including the distance to the next turn, second next turn, lane guidance, road name, and current street name. Perfect for keeping track of your route at every step of your journey. The widgets are active during navigation, ensuring you never miss a turn!

*Find them in: Menu → Configure screen → Top panel / Bottom panel → Route guidance: Next turn, Second next turn, Lanes*
