## New Compass Behavior

The compass button has been updated to provide more intuitive and user-friendly functionality. These improvements make the compass easier to use, help you navigate better, and optimize map orientation control during navigation.

[Compass button](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Reorients the map *to the North* in all map orientation modes. If the map is in the *Compass direction* mode, it rotates for one moment and then returns to the dynamic orientation of this mode.
- **Double tap**. Switch between map orientation modes, such as following the GPS direction or rotating with the device. *Until this update, you could switch modes using Single tap*.
- **Long tap**. Opens a handy list with the names of all map orientation modes, allowing you to select the one you prefer.


## Search by Brand Names

We are pleased to introduce a new [brand search](https://osmand.net/docs/user/search/search-poi#how-to-use) feature in OsmAnd that will allow you to find your favorite places faster. You can now filter POIs by specific brands, making it faster to find what you are looking for.  

Whether you are interested to find your favorite coffee shop, hotel, or reliable supermarket, this update makes discovering nearby locations from your favorite brands easier. Enjoy a personalized and efficient search and optimize your travels with OsmAnd.

## Profile Appearance Redesign

The [appearance of profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles/#my-location-appearance) has been improved to make them more interesting, recognizable, and usable. 
<!-- 
The update includes:

  - **View angle**. Displays a cone-shaped area that shows the direction you are currently facing.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  

  - **Location radius**. Shows a circular area around your icon, representing the accuracy of your current location.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  


##  Quick Action Updates
