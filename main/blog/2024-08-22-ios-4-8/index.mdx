### Speedometer for CarPlay

The [Speedometer widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/car-play#speedometer) has also been added for CarPlay. The Speedometer widget is profile-dependent, so if you change the settings for one profile, they will not be applied to another.

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/speedometer_carplay_2_ios.png) 


## Turn-by-turn Instructions

[Turn-by-turn information](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details/#turn-by-turn-information) provides detailed instructions for navigating your route. These instructions include information about your movements along the route.

![Navigation route Android](@site/static/img/navigation/route/navigation_turn_ios.png) 

## Road Side Indicator

Added Road side indicator for [Route Details](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details#road-side-indicator).  
The angle between the Destination (*Bearing from the last point*) and the last segment (*Bearing to the last 2 points of the route*) is measured and divided into 3 sectors of 120 degrees. 
* `-60 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; to &nbsp; &nbsp;`+60 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; = straight
* `-180 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; to &nbsp; &nbsp;`-60 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; = left
* `60 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; to &nbsp; &nbsp;`180 °`&nbsp; &nbsp; = right

## Quick Actions Tool Update

The updated **Add Action** screen makes it easier to customize and add [*Quick actions*](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action), improving access to important features. You can now find groups of actions, use the search function, and apply other actions to customize the *Quick Actions tool*, contributing to a better user experience.

![action](./img/add_action.png) ![action](./img/add_action_1.png)


## Custom Buttons

In this update, we have introduced **Custom buttons** in *Configure screen*, a unique type of [Quick action](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#custom-buttons) tool. Now users can create custom action buttons for their device screen.

_Menu → Configure screen → Buttons → Custom buttons → + → Add button_

![Custom button](./img/custom_button.png) ![Custom button](./img/custom_button_1.png)


## 3D Track Improvements

We have improved the [appearance of the 3D track](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/appearance#3d-track) and added more options for wall colors. Now you can customize wall colors based on _Altitude, Slope, Speed, Heart Rate, Bicycle Cadence, Bicycle Power_, or *Temperature*.

![3D track](./img/3d_track.png)


## Multiselect Mode for Tracks

[This menu item](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#three-dot-menu) allows you [to select the folders and routes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#selection-mode) required for further management.

_Menu → My Places → Tracks → &#8230; → Select_

![Multi selection on My Tracks](./img/multi_selection.png) ![Multi selection on My Tracks](./img/multi_selection_1.png)


## 3D My Location Icons

A new 3D view has been added for [My Location](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#profile-appearance) icons, which improves their visualization on the map. These changes bring the appearance of the icons in alignment with the 3D tilt of the map.   

![3D icon](./img/3d_icon.png)


## Color Palettes

In this release, new color palette schemes have been added.
- For [routes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/map-during-navigation#color): *Speed, Slope,* and *Elevation (Altitude)*.
- For [terrain](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/topography#hillshade-slope-and-altitude-layers): *Hillshade, Slope*, and *Altitude*.
- For [weather](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather#weather-layers): *All weather layers*.  

You can add your own color palette files to OsmAnd using the *import/export tool*. To do this, create a TXT file with the required name:
- *Routes*: `route_speed_name.txt`, `route_slope_default.txt`, `route_elevation_default.txt`.
- *Terrain*: `height_altitude_name.txt`, `hillshade_color_name.txt`, `slope_name.txt`.
- *Weather*: `weather_name.txt`.

For example:

```
TXT file named *height_altitude_0-200.txt*

# 0 - 90 degree RGBA
0,46,185,0,191
# yellow 
100,255,222,2,227
# red
200,255,1,1,255
# violet
220,130,1,255,255

```
After moving this TXT file to *..Android/data/net.osmand/files/color-palete/height_altitude_0-200.txt*, a new palette will appear in the Color Scheme menu.

![Color palette](./img/color_palette_2_ios.png) ![Color palette](./img/color_palette_1_ios.png)

Color palettes data is available in the [_Maps & Resources_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources#local) menu.

_Menu → Maps & Resources → Local → Colors_

![Color palette](./img/color_palette_ios.png)


## Weather Tool Improvements

Layer animations and improved labels make the [weather interface](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather) more visual and informative. These changes help you better understand current weather conditions and forecasts. Improved label visibility makes navigating weather data much easier.  

**Improvements**:
- **New weather panel** with an updated user interface.

<!--
Additional **Weather source options**.
  - Tap the ⚙ icon and select [GFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Forecast_System) or [ECMWF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Medium-Range_Weather_Forecasts).
-->

- **Weather animation**.
  - After making sure the weather layers are selected, tap the *Play* button on the *Weather* screen.
  
- A **Wind animation layer** has been added.

## Location Position on Screen

The [Location position on screen](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen/#display-position-location-position-on-screen) setting has been moved to the *Configure Screen* menu.

_Menu → Configure screen → Other → Location position on screen_

![Widget page](@site/static/img/widgets/conf_screen_display_position_ios.png) 


## Separate Speed Limit Alert

The [**Speed limit** screen alert](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/navigation-settings/#screen-alerts) has been separated from the *Traffic Warnings* screen alert.

## Login to OpenStreetMap

To improve security, [the option to authorize](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/osm-editing#authorization) with login and password has been removed. As of June 1, 2024, only [the new secure OAuth 2.0 method](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-iOS/issues/3736) will be supported.  This authorization method provides a higher level of information security to help protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.

The *Use username and password* button has been removed from: 

- *Login to* screen in the OSM Editing plugin menu.
- Benefits for active OSM contributors.
