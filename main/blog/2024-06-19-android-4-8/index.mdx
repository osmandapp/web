## Custom color palettes

New colorizations of color palette schemes have been added for:

- [Weather](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather#weather-layers): All weather layers.

Users can create and add their own color palettes. Simply compose your TXT file with the following names: _Terrain_ - `height_altitude_name.txt`, `hillshade_color_name.txt`, `slope_name.txt`, _Routes_ - `route_speed_name.txt`, `route_slope_default.txt`, `route_elevation_default.txt`, _Weather_ - `weather_name.txt`

*height_altitude_0-200.txt*

```
# 0 - 90 degree RGBA
