### Explore Winter Trails with OsmAnd’s Snowmobile Mode

When the landscape turns white and roads become snowy paths, OsmAnd is your perfect winter riding companion.

With the dedicated [**Snowmobile map style**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#snowmobile), you can easily identify official routes right on the map. Trails mapped as [`route=snowmobile`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:route%3Dsnowmobile) in OpenStreetMap appear clearly, distinct from standard roads. Snowmobile map legend is [here](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map-legend/snowmobile-map). Because OsmAnd works completely offline, you can rely on guidance even in backcountry areas with zero network coverage. 

Just tap on a visible trail on the map to [follow the track](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation#follow-track-options) and start your adventure.

### Personalize Your Ride

To make your rides even more tailored to the season, you can [**create a custom Snowmobile profile**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles).

Choose a snowmobile icon fit for your vehicle, set a distinct profile color, and adjust navigation preferences such as speed display, routing types, or road avoidances.  Choose [Snowmobile map style](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#snowmobile) for this profile.   
Whether you’re on a short local ride or a cross-country expedition, your settings will be ready the moment you switch profiles.

### Example: Snowmobiling in Maine

Maine boasts nearly 11,000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails, including the famous Interconnected Trail System (ITS) covering hubs like The County, Eustis, Jackman, and Rangeley.

To explore these, simply switch to the Snowmobile map style in OsmAnd ([_Menu → Configure map → Map style → Snowmobile_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#snowmobile)), download the [US map region](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps#maps-and-resources) for offline use, and tap any trail for guidance.

For a ready-to-go setup, we have prepared a custom [**Snowmobile Profile OSF file**](https://osmand.net/uploads/osf/Snowmobile.osf). Importing this file will automatically set up your profile icon, colors, necessary settings. Just open the `.osf` file in OsmAnd to activate it instantly.  
Additionaly for the USA I propose to install  the [US Maps Plugin](https://osmand.net/uploads/plugins/us.maps/2/us.maps-2.osf) with Public and Private lands (read more about the US Maps Plugin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OsmAnd/comments/19erp5z/padus_usgs_topo_usgs_national_map_arcgis_world/)). 
* [Download Snowmobile Profile](https://osmand.net/uploads/osf/Snowmobile.osf) and open by the OsmAnd app
* [The US Maps Plugin](https://osmand.net/uploads/plugins/us.maps/2/us.maps-2.osf)
