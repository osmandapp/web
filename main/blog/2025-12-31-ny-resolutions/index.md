Happy New Year from OsmAnd!

As we welcome 2026, we reflect on an exciting year behind us — one that marked OsmAnd's 15th anniversary and introduced major innovations to our navigation experience. Among the most significant milestones of 2025 was the launch of our new fast offline routing, designed to make your routes smoother, calculations quicker, and travel even more efficient — no internet connection required.

This breakthrough, together with continuous design improvements and enhanced usability, brought OsmAnd to a new level for millions of users worldwide. Now, as we move into 2026, we're ready to build on that foundation, shaping the future of navigation with even smarter, more connected solutions.

The journey continues — and we're thrilled to have you with us.

## 2026 New Year Resolutions

At OsmAnd, every new year brings fresh ideas and an even stronger drive to make navigation smarter, faster, and more intuitive. As we step into 2026, we're excited to continue innovating and delivering a more seamless experience for every traveler.

Here's a glimpse of what's coming next.

## Map

### 3D Buildings

![3D Buildings](./img/3d_buildings.png)

*A new dimension of exploration.*  
Discover maps like never before with detailed 3D building representations that make navigation more immersive and visually engaging. This update also introduces dynamic lighting, rendering realistic sun positions and cast shadows based on the time of day.


### Globe View

![Globe View](./img/globe_view.png) ![Globe View](./img/globe_view-1.png)

Experience the world as it truly is — round!  
In 2026, OsmAnd will introduce **Globe View**, allowing you to see the planet from a global perspective and seamlessly plan routes across continents.

### Adjustable Map Style

![Map Legend](./img/legend.png)

In 2025, we expanded [route configuration options](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/routes#display-routes-on-the-map).  
Next in 2026, we're releasing a **Adjustable Map Style** — giving you full control over how your map looks and helping you understand every layer at a glance. Tailor your OsmAnd maps perfectly for your next adventure.

## Routes

### Route Details & Alerts

![Route Details](./img/extended_route_details.png)

Gain deeper insights into your journey with expanded route details. We are improving the overview of time, distance, and alternative transportation options so you can make smarter decisions on the fly.

### Alternative routes

We are launching a dedicated tool to generate Alternative Routes and automated Roundtrips. This feature will calculate paths that take into account your specific advanced routing preferences.

### Share your Location & GPX

*Stay connected. Share the adventure.*  

We have already implemented GPX sharing on the Web platform and Autosync with the cloud for Android. The next step is to finalize a solution for sharing data with your friends and family directly from OsmAnd, eliminating the need for 3rd party tools.

### Public GPX Track Collection

In 2025, we added the ability to store extra data in GPX files, such as Keywords & Activity types, which are then provided to the OpenStreetMap website. Now, we are ready to utilize this data to organize tracks by activity and visualize all the publicly available tracks that you have uploaded.

## Miscellaneous

### Manage Favorites & Media

Revamping the Favorites screen has been a goal of ours for quite some time. This year, we are moving forward with a major redesign. Beyond just a fresh look, we are expanding the functionality to handle media attachments and organize locations into smart folders. Our goal is to transform your Favorites into a rich personal travel log.

### Astronomy Plugin

![Astronomy](./img/astronomy.png) ![Astronomy](./img/astronomy-1.png)

We're reaching for the stars — literally.  
A new **Astronomy plugin** will arrive in 2026, letting you identify planets, stars, and constellations right from your map. Explore the night sky as easily as you explore the Earth.

### Smartwatches

![Smartwatch](./img/smartwatch.png)

In 2025, we laid the groundwork for wearable integration — and now it's coming to life! In 2026, OsmAnd will launch Smartwatch support, allowing you to browse and record tracks, or follow navigation instructions right from your wrist. Compact, convenient, and perfect for explorers on the move. Specific updates include:

- Garmin Connect integration: Seamless trip recording and data syncing.
- Navigation: Turn-by-turn instructions displayed directly on your watch.

### Pricing

To support ongoing development, rising infrastructure costs, and new features planned for this year, subscription and in‑app prices will slightly increase in 2026. This adjustment helps us maintain OsmAnd's high quality, enhance user support, and bring even more value through future updates.
