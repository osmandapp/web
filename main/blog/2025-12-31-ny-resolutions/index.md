Happy New Year from OsmAnd!

As we welcome 2026, we reflect on an exciting year behind us — one that marked OsmAnd’s 15th anniversary and introduced major innovations to our navigation experience. Among the most significant milestones of 2025 was the launch of our new fast offline routing, designed to make your routes smoother, calculations quicker, and travel even more efficient — no internet connection required.

This breakthrough, together with continuous design improvements and enhanced usability, brought OsmAnd to a new level for millions of users worldwide. Now, as we move into 2026, we’re ready to build on that foundation, shaping the future of navigation with even smarter, more connected solutions.

The journey continues — and we’re thrilled to have you with us.
