At OsmAnd, each year brings exciting advancements in external device connectivity. In 2023, we introduced external sensor support. In 2024, it was the OBD-II protocol. Now, for 2025, we’re thrilled to announce smartwatch integration!

With this new feature, you’ll be able to browse and record tracks or view simple navigation instructions directly on your wrist.


### Explore popular places
