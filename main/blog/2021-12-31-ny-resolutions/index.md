Happy New 2022 Year!

At the end of each year, we sum up the results of the passing year and write our plans for the next one. This tradition started 5 years ago and we continue doing it each year. Sometimes our ambitions are not nearly completed, sometimes we overshoot the plan.

<!--truncate-->

2021 was another difficult year for most of us, so it was for OsmAnd as well. Though we wish that 2 COVID years are over and we finally can go back to our normal traveling life with Maps. In our <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/2021-ny-resolutions">2021 New Year resolutions</a> we anticipated the difficulties and wrote a rather simple for our team list which we consider as 90% completed.

One of the biggest achievements of 2021 is that we’ve managed to double our Team up to 20 people and this Team delivers features with quite an incredible pace.


## <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OsmAnd/comments/rt1a2b/2022_new_year_resolutions/">2022 New Year Resolutions</a>


We will start with the list for 2022 and below you can double-check how a similar list was crushed in 2021 😉

## OsmAnd Pro

![OsmAnd Pro](./1.png)


* Introduce OsmAnd Pro features to **<i>iOS</i>** and make unified multi-platform synchronization, make the synchronization work automagically.
* Develop richer variety of valuable features.
* Promote OsmAnd Pro features to Paid and later to Free version.


**Note:** our vision is that after 1-2 years OsmAnd Pro features that don’t require cost per user will become available for Lifetime payment.

## OpenGL / 3D - Fast Maps

![OpenGL](./3dmaps.png) 


* **Android**: we plan to introduce the new fast OpenGL rendering engine and unify our iOS / Android experience.
* We plan to significantly improve features of 3D rendering and fix our long term issues.



## Documentation
![Documentation](./documentation.png) 
**Android / iOS / Web:** we plan to finally update our features website and introduce documentation, so we can synchronize it with all platforms and probably introduce a few translations.


## Weather
![Documentation](./weather.png) 

**Android / iOS / Web:** let’s bring the weather forecast to OsmAnd and as usual make it a very powerful tool for offline travelers.


## Plan Route

![Plan route](./planroute.png) 



**Android / iOS / Web:** even though many features were released in 2021, we still have some plans for 2022.


* Build User Interface so we can plan a route by picking up points from an existing node network.
* Easily select OSM routes from the map and include their segments to our new route.
* Configure roundabout trips with a given distance, features list and our preferences.


## Widgets

![Widgets](./widgets.png)  
**Android / iOS:** introduce more powerful widgets and make it easier to access a bigger variety of them on the map.


## Tracks
![Tracks](./tracks.png) 


**Android / iOS / Web:** redesign how we search, store, enable tracks on the map and provide the heatmap for our existing tracks.

## Quick actions / Customization
**iOS:** bring customization to the same level as we have in Android, so we can configure Drawer / Context Menu etc for our selected profiles.

**Android / iOS:** introduce a more powerful concept of Quick actions, so users can configure more than 1 quickly accessible button on the map.

## Routing

![Routing](./routing.png) 

   

In 2021 we’ve implemented the possibility to use custom Online Routing and switch to offline once it’s not available. In 2022 we finally plan to take care of our existing bidirectional A*-routing and to improve it with Contraction Hierarchies ideas.
