# OsmAnd Builds {#osmand-builds}

OsmAnd releases several Ready-To-Use builds every day, which allows you to follow new features and participate in OsmAnd's contribution (translation process).

## Google Play Beta builds (monthly) {#google-play-beta-builds-monthly}

The Google Play Store offers to test beta versions of
apps, which enables you to (temporarily) download and use the test
version from the Google Play Store instead of the standard release
version(s).

For OsmAnd this means that you can participate in testing the new *OsmAnd
free* or the new *OsmAnd+* paid versions. This enables you to use and test
exciting new features. Of course, using a beta version also means that
you might encounter bugs or app crashes.

The Google Play Store mechanism also supports the easy return to the
standard version from the Google Play Store.


### Activating the test version {#activating-the-test-version}

Register as tester for the OsmAnd free test version via the following [Google Group OsmAnd](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand). Register for the *OsmAnd+* paid test version via the following [Google Group OsmAnd+](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand.plus/testing) (note: this is only possible if you are a registered user for the paid version).

- When you click the link to register, you will see a big blue or green panel advertising "Be a test user" (in your defined language).
- After clicking the "button" you will see the message "You are now a tester" with a green check-mark in front of it (and on repetitive actions it will show "You are a tester").
- Give Google some time to synchronize which can be anywhere between 10 seconds or 60 minutes.
- Now you can download the test version, either directly from the Google Play Store, or via your phone/tablet.

### Returning to the standard Google Play Store OsmAnd version {#returning-to-the-standard-google-play-store-osmand-version}

Note that the same registration screen, after having registered, also has a link "Leave the test version". If, after some time, you want to use the current standard release version from the Google Play Store again, proceed as follows:

- Use the above link again (so you better make this a bookmark/favorite in your browser). The page will still inform "You are a tester".
- The page also contains the link "Leave the test version".
- Click that link to then see "You have left the test version".
- Manually uninstall the test version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.
- Manually (re)install the current version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.

**Note**: Before changing to the test version, export your OsmAnd favorites. The new test version should simply continue using the favorites but as it is a beta version for testing, you never know.

## Android Nightly Builds (nightly) {#android-nightly-builds-nightly}

Different builds of OsmAnd should be installed over any other build of the same strain (older or newer) without any issues, and with all offline data being preserved. The latest development build (*not necessarily stable !*) for testing can be found [here](https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAnd-default.apk). This will usually be updated over any other development build of the same development generation. If attempting to upgrade results in a signature error or “not installed” ( for example, if you are currently using the marketplace or want to upgrade to an older build), please  

- export your Favorites first (Menu/Export in the favorites list),
- export Navigation profiles,
- uninstall the previous version,
- re-install the new development build,
- re-import your Favorites again (Menu/Import),
All maps/tracks etc. are kept in place unchanged during this procedure.

## iOS Testflight builds (weekly) {#ios-testflight-builds-weekly}

To join TestFlight beta builds, you can follow the [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/7poGNCKy). iOS builds usually are provided weekly (after the team sprint demo). They don't have descriptions and could have continuous versioning. They are supposed to be stable and ready to use.
