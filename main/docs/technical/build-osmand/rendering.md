# Create New Rendering Style {#create-new-rendering-style}

Creating a new rendering style is possible without any changes in the program. However, defining a style can be complicated if you want to write it from scratch, like the Nautical or Default styles (15 thousand lines of code). It is recommended to create dependent styles so you can change the style in small chunks. For example, the UniRS style mostly redefines the colors and appearance of icons.

To test the rendering style, you can use the OsmAnd Map Creator. In case you want to use OsmAnd on a device. You need to put the XML definition of the style in a folder on the SD card (“rendering”) next to the other rendering styles.

All rights to the style created belong to the author, although these rights cannot be applied to OsmAnd's executable files.
