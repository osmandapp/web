# Creating a Consistent User Experience {#creating-a-consistent-user-experience}

Usability of our complex features is decisively enhanced by wording and good translations, and as much consistency as possible. It is worth thinking about many expressions or sentences for a little while. :)

Please note the following:

## 1. Consistent Wording {#1-consistent-wording}

Use only **one expression** for a certain feature, do not mix two possible expressions. Examples:

* Check for existing expressions and re-use them in new strings
* Use _"navigation"_, not _"routing"_, throughout.
* Use _"tracking"_, not _"monitoring"_
* We use _"position"_ for where you are, while _"location"_ refers to arbitrary points
* We use _"destination"_, not _"target"_
* We use _"speed"_, not _"velocity"_
* Know the difference between _"elevation"_ and _"altitude"_
* It is _"OsmAnd"_ now, not _"Osmand"_  :)

## 2. Authoring Text {#2-authoring-text}

* Please try to re-use existing string constants as much as possible, it is good for memory and performance.
* For highly re-usable strings 'XXX' we often have a `shared_string_XXX`
* Strings are often re-used! When changing existing strings, please double-check with _all_ their occurrences in the code
* Unnecessary text clutters screens without helping much. Please be short and precise, only add words which convey _necessary_ information.
* Please double-check the appearance of wording in the app, in particular on low-density devices. Too many line breaks, cut-off text or blown-up menu buttons may make a screen or dialog unusable.
* In some cases there are conventions, which may be worth checking, rather than "inventing something". So if 99% of commercial navigation systems in your language announce "you have reached your destination", then using "you have arrived at where you wanted to go" may not be the best of choices... :)
* Clearly mark all features which require Internet access with the expression "online".
* The base language for OsmAnd is American English. There is a translation folder for British English for all expressions and spelling that differs.

## 3. Rendering {#3-rendering}

* A note about rendering: The map appearance of our Maps styles has been tested for usabilityand visibility at a multitude of map locations, with many devices and screen technologies, and under different light conditions. _"Spontaneous improvements"_ to the renderer are almost always questionable, may at least require more investigation and testing than you may think... :)
