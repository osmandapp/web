# Tiles SQLite Format - .sqlite {#tiles-sqlite-format---sqlite}



The SQLIte format used in OsmAnd is based on the "BigPlanet" SQLite as supported by MOBAC. In OsmAnd we add a number of tables extending the format:

|Table|Column|Spec and Purpose|
|:----|:-----|:---------------|
|"info"|"url"|String. URL template to download tiles with zoom ≣ `{z}` ≣ `{0}`, `{x}` ≣ `{1}`, `{y}` ≣ `{2}`, server name ≣ `{rnd}`|
||"randoms"|String. The names of the mirrors of server. Comma-separated. One of these values will randomly replace the placeholder `{rdn}` in "url" field.|
||"referer"|String. HTTP Referer. As used for downloading.|
||"rule"|String. Supported template:1 (same as empty), wms_tile, yandex_traffic. Adds specific algorithms how tiles will be downloaded. wms_tile is using proxy server such as whoots.mapwarper.net to deal with WMS sources |
||"useragent"|String. HTTP User Agent. As used for downloading.|
||"minzoom"|Integer. Min zoom level. Respective integer. (Also inverted in case of BigPlanet).|
||"maxzoom"|Integer. Max zoom level. Respective integer. (Also inverted in case of BigPlanet).|
||"ellipsoid"|Integer 0 or 1. 1 for Elliptic Mercator (Yandex tiles). 0 for regular Spheric Web Mercator (OSM, Google maps)|
||"inverted\_y"|Integer 0 or 1. 1 for inverted Y tile number (Nakarte.me tiles).|
||"timecolumn"|String "yes" or "no". A tiles table with a "time" column indicates when each tile was retrieved.|
||"expireminutes"|Integer. Specifies if tiles shall expire after the given number of minutes. They would still be displayed, but also re-downloaded.|
||"tilenumbering"|String "" or "BigPlanet". If "BigPlanet", zoom will be inverted and calculated as z = 17 - zoom.|
||"tilesize"| Integer. Empty or 256 or 512, optional, it is used to describe what's the tile size|
|"tiles"|"x", "y", "z"|Integer. Indicates tile Mercator coordinates. Note that zoom could be inverted for the BigPlanet case.|
||"image"|Blob of image bytes.|
||"time"|Integer. Time stamp when image was downloaded.|

This format is also used by Hillshade and Slope files distributed by OsmAnd application.

The class supporting this is SQLiteTileSource at or near [https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/resources/SQLiteTileSource.java#L36](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/resources/SQLiteTileSource.java#L36).
