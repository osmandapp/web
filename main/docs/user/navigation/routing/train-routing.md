## Overview {#overview}

:::note
By default, *Train profile* is deactivated. To use this profile for routing, you need to switch it on in *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_settings,application_profiles"/>*.
:::

*Train routing* in OsmAnd provides users with possibility to use railroad lines for navigation as if they were driving a train like a car. This option can be useful, for example, for hiking when no other roads are available. In other cases it's better to use *[Public transport routing](./public-transport-navigation.md)*.

*Train routing* can be configured according to your needs in the [Route parameters section](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#route-parameters) of the Navigation settings.  


## Other Routing Settings {#other-routing-settings}

- The routing algorithm can also consider temporary limitations specified in OpenStreetMap. This can be done using *[<Translate android="true" ids="temporary_conditional_routing"/>](../routing/osmand-routing.md#consider-temporary-limitations)* option. Note that in some cases, information from OSM can be outdated.  

- In the [*Recalculate route section*](../../navigation/guidance/navigation-settings.md#recalculate-route) of the *Route parameters*, you can enable and adjust route recalculation options.

- In the [*Development section*](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#development-settings) of the *Route parameters*, you can try new routing features that are currently in the testing phase. Note, that these settings are only available when the [OsmAnd development plugin](../../plugins/development.md) is enabled.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="road_speeds"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#road-speeds)* setting in the *iOS* version of OsmAnd is located in *Navigation settings → Route parameters* (for *Android*, in *Vehicle parameters → [<Translate android="true" ids="default_speed_setting_title"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#default-speed--road-speeds)*). These settings can also be set for *Direct-to-point* routing. It is used to calculate Estimated Time of Arrival.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="vehicle_parameters"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#vehicle-parameters)*. Properly configuring the settings will help you avoid problems when creating a route. You can select the most appropriate route depending on the type of vehicle and road restrictions, as well as calculate the travel time.
