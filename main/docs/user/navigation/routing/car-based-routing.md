## Overview {#overview}

Car-based routing is designed to help drivers navigate the roads efficiently, safely, and comfortably, by providing customized directions tailored to each driver's unique needs and preferences. Proper routing settings can help drivers save time and fuel, and avoid hazards on the road. The fastest routing is offered by default.

:::info
The routing mechanism for motorized ground vehicles differs only in a few settings. The common parameters are described in the [Car](#route-parameters---car) section of this article. [Truck](#route-parameters---truck) and [Motorcycle](#route-parameters---motorcycle) have their own particularities.  
:::

Routing can be configured according to your needs in the [Route parameters section](../../navigation/guidance/navigation-settings.md#route-parameters) of the Navigation settings of the corresponding profile (*Driving, Truck, Motorcycle*).  


## Route Parameters - Car {#route-parameters---car}

Car routing is designed to help drivers find the most efficient and direct routes to their destinations. It takes into account common driving restrictions, such as one-way streets, ban on turns, pedestrian zones, and also helps avoid roads that are not suitable for cars, such as narrow roads or roads with weight limitations.

## Route Parameters - Truck {#route-parameters---truck}

Truck routing is similar to car routing, but is designed specifically for drivers of large commercial vehicles. It considers additional factors such as vehicle [height, weight, and width restrictions](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#size-parameters) and the possibility to transport hazardous materials (check table below). All other routing settings are identical to [car routing](#route-parameters---car).

## Route Parameters - Motorcycle {#route-parameters---motorcycle}

:::

Motorcycle routing is the process of creating a route specifically optimized for motorcycle travel. This type of routing takes into account the unique needs and preferences of motorcyclists, providing the best possible riding conditions. Routes are laid out taking into account a number of parameters such as choice of road surface ( for example, poor road conditions can be preferred or avoided), avoidance of traffic jams, accessibility of infrastructure or safety.


## Other Routing Settings {#other-routing-settings}

- The routing algorithm can also consider temporary limitations specified in OpenStreetMap. This can be done using *[<Translate android="true" ids="temporary_conditional_routing"/>](../routing/osmand-routing.md#consider-temporary-limitations)* option. Note that in some cases, information from OSM can be outdated.  

- In the [*Recalculate route section*](../../navigation/guidance/navigation-settings.md#recalculate-route) of the *Route parameters*, you can enable and adjust route recalculation options.

- In the [*Development section*](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#development-settings) of the *Route parameters*, you can try new routing features that are currently in the testing phase. Note, that these settings are only available when the [OsmAnd development plugin](../../plugins/development.md) is enabled.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="road_speeds"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#road-speeds)* setting in the *iOS* version of OsmAnd is located in *Navigation settings → Route parameters* (for *Android*, in *Vehicle parameters → [<Translate android="true" ids="default_speed_setting_title"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#default-speed--road-speeds)*). This setting is used on unknown roads without speed limits. This is most often the case when navigating a track or online route. It must be set according to the parameters of your vehicle.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="vehicle_parameters"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#vehicle-parameters)*. Properly configuring the settings will help you avoid problems when creating a route. You can select the most appropriate route depending on the type of vehicle and road restrictions, as well as calculate the travel time.
