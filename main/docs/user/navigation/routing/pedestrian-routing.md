## Overview {#overview}

Pedestrian routing refers to the process of finding the best route for a pedestrian to travel from one location to another, taking into account factors such as pedestrian-only areas, sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian-friendly intersections. It may also consider other factors such as *stairs*, which may be useful for wheelchair accessibility. OsmAnd always uses elevation data when calculating the estimated time of arrival (time to cover the distance) according to [Naismith's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith%27s_rule#Scarf's_equivalence_between_distance_and_climb).

To configure *Pedestrian routing* go to the [Route parameters section](../guidance/navigation-settings#route-parameters) of the Navigation settings.
  
### Route Parameters - Walking {#route-parameters---walking}

Pedestrian routing can be useful not only in urban areas, where pedestrians may encounter various obstacles when trying to get from one place to another. You can also use this routing type while jogging, hiking, and Nordic walking outside the city or in the mountains. Simply adjust routing parameters according to your needs.

This textured ground surface indicator system may be installed on footpaths, stairs and public transportation platforms to assist blind or visually impaired pedestrians in moving. </li></ul> |
| *<Translate android="true" ids="routing_attr_allow_private_name"/>* |  Private access restrictions will be ignored when route calculating.  | Tag *[private](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access)* is used in OSM to describe restrictions on the use of highways and other transportation routes, as well as buildings, entrances, amenities, and leisure entities.   |
|*<Translate android="true" ids="routing_attr_height_obstacles_name"/>* | <details><summary> Elevation data will be used in route calculation: [penalties](../../../technical/osmand-file-formats/osmand-routing-xml.md#penalties-of-elevation-data) will be set for roads that differ from the selected type. </summary> ![Use elevation data Android](@site/static/img/navigation/routing/pedestrian_elevation_andr.png)  </details> | This preference can help avoid steep hills or vice versa, prefer them. Using this option may be very helpful in pedestrian routing. Without elevation data the fastest route as on plain terrain will be calculated. |
|*<Translate android="true" ids="routing_attr_allow_via_ferrata_name"/>*| *Via ferrata* routes will be used for routing when this option together with *Use elevation data* enabled.  | [Via ferrata](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dvia_ferrata) is a mountain route equipped with fixed cables, stemples, ladders, and bridges. |


## Other Routing Settings {#other-routing-settings}

- The routing algorithm can also consider temporary limitations specified in OpenStreetMap. This can be done using *[<Translate android="true" ids="temporary_conditional_routing"/>](../routing/osmand-routing.md#consider-temporary-limitations)* option. Note that in some cases, information from OSM can be outdated.  

- In the [*Recalculate route section*](../../navigation/guidance/navigation-settings.md#recalculate-route) of the *Route parameters*, you can enable and adjust route recalculation options.

- In the [*Development section*](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#development-settings) of the *Route parameters*, you can try new routing features that are currently in the testing phase. Note, that these settings are only available when the [OsmAnd development plugin](../../plugins/development.md) is enabled.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="road_speeds"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#road-speeds)* setting in the *iOS* version of OsmAnd is located in *Navigation settings → Route parameters* (for *Android*, in *Vehicle parameters → [<Translate android="true" ids="default_speed_setting_title"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#default-speed--road-speeds)*). This setting is used on unknown roads without speed limits. This is most often the case when navigating a track or online route. It must be set according to the parameters of your vehicle.

- *[<Translate ios="true" ids="vehicle_parameters"/>](../guidance/navigation-settings.md#vehicle-parameters)*. Properly configuring the settings will help you avoid problems when creating a route. You can select the most appropriate route depending on the type of vehicle and road restrictions, as well as calculate the travel time.
