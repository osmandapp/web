## Overview {#overview}

Driving a vehicle and using your phone or tablet at the same time is usually forbidden by law for safety reasons. [***CarPlay***](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) is software that provides an adapted and optimized version of the OsmAnd app for safe use while driving, making it easier and more secure to access the app's navigation functions.

To use *CarPlay* on your vehicle screen, follow these steps:

1. *CarPlay* is not available in all countries. Make sure it is supported in your [country or region](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/feature-availability/#applecarplay-applecarplay) and that *CarPlay* is supported in your [vehicle model](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/).
2. [Connect your device](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203412) to your vehicle multimedia system using a USB port or wirelessly with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. When connecting for the first time, you may need permission to use *CarPlay* on your device.
3. Once connected, the *CarPlay interface* will automatically appear on your vehicle screen with all available apps. If the *CarPlay home screen* does not appear, select the *CarPlay logo* on the vehicle display.  

#### CarPlay Interface {#carplay-interface}

*CarPlay* is **not a direct replication** of the OsmAnd mobile app. It has a simplified interface, focusing on essential navigation functions to ensure safe driving. Some advanced features are not supported due to platform limitations.

### Connection Screen {#connection-screen}

![CarPlay](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_connect_screen.png)

While your device is connected to *CarPlay*, the map on the app screen is locked. This is an intentional security feature to ensure that navigation is controlled exclusively from the car display, minimizing distractions while driving. Check the [common questions](#common-issues-and-solutions) about the connection screen.


### Location Position in CarPlay {#location-position-in-carplay}

The OsmAnd app for *CarPlay* allows you to adjust the position of the current location indicator on the screen to avoid overlapping the route and other important map details.

**How to change the indicator position:**

- Go to *Menu → Configure screen → Other → [Location position on screen](../widgets/configure-screen.md#display-position-location-position-on-screen)*.
- Select your preferred placement:
    - **Automatic (default)**. The application automatically shifts the position of the indicator for navigation mode or free movement.
    - **Center**. The indicator is placed in the center of the screen, suitable for standard navigation.
    - **Bottom**. The indicator is positioned closer to the bottom of the screen, making it easier to observe surrounding objects and complex intersections.

### Interaction with the Map {#interaction-with-the-map}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-Interaction(1).png)

*CarPlay* displays the OsmAnd interface adapted to the vehicle multimedia system screen. Interaction with the map is limited to:  

- [My Location](../widgets/map-buttons.md#my-location-and-zoom). Moves the visible part of the map so that your current location is in the center of the screen.
- [Zoom](../widgets/map-buttons.md#my-location-and-zoom). Allows you to zoom in and out of the visible part of the map.


## Required Setup Parameters {#required-setup-parameters}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-select-point-1.png)

- First, you need to select and configure the profile to be used when connecting to *CarPlay*. You can read how to configure a profile in the article [Profiles (Settings)](../personal/profiles).  
    - A convenient profile for using *CarPlay* can be *Driving*, and the type of routing can be [Car routing](../navigation/routing/car-based-routing.md).
    - OsmAnd has a separate item [CarPlay Profile](#carplay-profile) for quick access to the list of profiles available for connecting to *CarPlay*.
- For OsmAnd to work, [connect your iOS device](#overview) to the vehicle multimedia system. To find out more about how to connect and set up your device, you can visit the [**CarPlay**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205634) website.
- You need to have one of [OsmAnd paid or subscription](../purchases/ios#free-and-paid-features). Check it here *Menu → Settings → Purchases*.
- Once connected, you can set a destination and start OsmAnd navigation in *CarPlay*.  

:::note
You may need an Internet connection to use OsmAnd in *CarPlay*. If your device has limited Internet access, you can [*preload or create routes*](../personal/tracks/manage-tracks.md) and use them without the Internet.
:::


### Start Navigation {#start-navigation}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-start(1).png)  

To use the iOS version of the OsmAnd app in *CarPlay*, you have to purchase a [paid version of the app or to subscribe](../purchases/ios#free-and-paid-features).  

1. To create a route, you need to choose the [route endpoint](#select-a-route-endpoint) on the *CarPlay screen* or in the [OsmAnd app](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md).
2. You can use [voice prompts](#voice-prompts) to listen for directions or messages about issues on the road.  
3. After you select a location, press **Start** to follow the route.
4. As you drive, the vehicle screen will display OsmAnd information about your current location on the map, driving directions, distance to the next turn, lines, arrival time and distance to your destination.
    ![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_navmode.png)  
5. If you want to change your route or select a different location, you can press the appropriate button on the screen.
6. Once you have completed your route, you can deactivate *CarPlay* by disconnecting the device from your vehicle multimedia system.

:::note
All categories for **route endpoint** selection, *[History](#history), [POIs](#poi-categories), [Markers](#map-markers), [Search](#search), [Favorites](#favorites), and [Tracks](#tracks)* may contain no more list items than your vehicle multimedia system provides. Typically, in most vehicles, lists are dynamically limited to 12 or 24 items. This means that the list in *CarPlay* may not be complete. The total number of items and the actual number of items displayed is indicated under the folder name.
:::  


### CarPlay Profile {#carplay-profile}

*<Translate ios="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_settings,carplay_profile"/>*  
![General Settings Default profile Android](@site/static/img/personal/profiles/CarPlay_ios.png)

**CarPlay profile** is a specific profile in the OsmAnd app for convenient use of your car's audio and video system for further display of this data on your phone.  

This profile is used as long as your device is connected to *CarPlay*. Tap the *CarPlay profile* field in the *OsmAnd settings* menu and from the list of [profiles enabled for use](../personal/profiles.md) select the profile with which *CarPlay* will be activated.  

You cannot select a profile directly in *CarPlay* from the vehicle screen. First, select the required profile on your device and attach the *CarPlay profile* to it. You should select a profile that corresponds to the type of vehicle, such as *Driving*, *Truck*, *Car*, *Motorcycle*, or *Moped*. **The app will automatically activate** the *CarPlay profile* when connected to a vehicle.

**Why it is important to select the appropriate profile for your type of vehicle.**

- **Driving safety.** Different types of transportation require different information and settings when driving. For example, truck drivers may be limited in the height, weight, and width of their vehicles, so the *Truck* profile provides them with appropriate restrictions and guidelines. While bicyclists and motorcyclists need information about bike lanes and routes, without data for trucks.
- **Utility and Efficiency.** Navigation should be customized to meet the needs of a particular mode of transportation. This allows users to reduce the time it takes to find optimal routes and avoid unnecessary traffic restrictions.


## Select a Route Endpoint {#select-a-route-endpoint}

You can select previously preset and added [POIs](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#points-of-interest-poi), or [Favorites](../personal/favorites.md), or [Markers](../personal/markers.md) as a destination point. It is also possible to select a recorded or downloaded [Track](../personal/tracks/index.md) for the route, use the [Search](../search/index.md), or select a destination from the route [History](../search/search-history.md).

1. If you want a particular location on the map as an endpoint, select the appropriate category of points from the list, [POIs](#poi-categories), [Favorites](#favorites), or [Map Markers](#map-markers).  
  
    - All categories can contain no more list items than are provided by your vehicle multimedia system. This means that the list in *CarPlay* could be incomplete, and all other folders are only available in the OsmAnd app on your device.
    - The [Last modified](#folder-last-modified) folder contains a list of recent destinations, sorted by date added or changed.
    - The list of all other folders is sorted by the most recent update, new folders are at the top of the list. It is not possible to change their order manually.
    - The list of points within folders is sorted by the distance to them, starting with the nearest. Each point has a name or coordinates, a shaped icon (color and icon set by default or chosen by you in the OsmAnd application), and the distance from the point of the current location to it.
2. Select the [History](#history) category to find one of the recent destinations that are stored in the device's memory.
3. Select [Search](#search) to enter a destination from the available search categories.

:::note
While driving, selected points can be [announced](#voice-prompts) when you approach or pass them. See the [Voice prompts](../navigation/guidance/voice-navigation.md) settings in the appropriate article to set up voice notifications.
:::


### History {#history}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_history.png)  

In the **History category**, you can select a destination from a list of endpoints.

- They are sorted by most recent use, starting with the newest ones.
- This can be convenient for quick access to frequently used routes.
- To learn how to use or delete a destination, read the [Search History](../search/search-history.md) article.


### POI Categories {#poi-categories}

<table class="image">
    <tr>
        <td><img src={require('@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_poi_1.png').default} alt="CP"/></td>
        <td><img src={require('@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_poi.png').default} alt="CP"/></td>
    </tr>
</table>

*POIs (Points of Interest)* are a type of points that identify places or objects on the map that are important or of interest to users. They are highlighted by special icons provided in the [OsmAnd settings](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#poi-types) and sorted into groups.  

To build a route to a *POI* in *CarPlay*, follow these steps:

1. Select the needed *POI* from the list of available categories, or enter the name of the POI using [Search](#search).
2. OsmAnd calculates the route and displays it on the *CarPlay screen*. Tap the **Start** button to start navigating to that location.
3. Depending on your OsmAnd app settings and your vehicle, you may receive [voice prompts](#voice-prompts) to guide you to your destination.
4. When you arrive at the location, the app will notify you that you have reached the *POI*.


### Favorites {#favorites}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-favorites(1).png)  

**Favorites** is one of the features of OsmAnd that allows you to make a kind of notes on the map.

- While using **CarPlay**, you cannot add or modify *Favorites*, only use existing ones.
- The list of [Favorites](../personal/favorites.md#manage-favorites) can be found in the OsmAnd app *Menu → My Places → Favorites*.
- If you want to use them for navigation, configure everything you need before connecting the device to your vehicle multimedia system.  


### Map Markers {#map-markers}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-markers(1).png)  

- To define your final destination as a *Map marker*, you first need to create the required number of markers in the OsmAnd app on your device before connecting it to the vehicle multimedia system.
- *Markers* need to be available in the *Menu → Map marker* list.
- This is described in more detail in the [Markers](../personal/markers.md) article.  


### Tracks {#tracks}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-tracks(1).png)  

To build a route to a destination, you can select an existing track available in the OsmAnd app. The track can be [downloaded](../personal/tracks/manage-tracks.md#import) in advance, used as [recorded](../plugins/trip-recording.md) or created in [Plan a route](../plan-route/create-route.md).  

From the list of tracks in the *Menu → My Places → [Tracks](../personal/tracks/manage-tracks.md)*, select the required one before connecting to the vehicle multimedia system, and the route will either build up to the start of the track or display the current direction along the track.  

Tracks can also be selected directly on the vehicle screen in *CarPlay*. They are organized in folders you have created, and for easy and quick access to recently opened tracks, there is a special folder [Last modified](#folder-last-modified).


### Search {#search}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-search(1).png)  

Going to **Search** gives you quick access to a list of recent [destination history](#history). Similarly with the [Navigation menu](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#navigation-menu), where all OsmAnd destination methods such as an address, POIs, or coordinates are collected.  

You can use the *Search tool* to find the required place on the map for route planning from any available search category.

- [Address](../search/search-address.md). Start typing the address in the search field.
- [POI](../search/search-poi.md) and [Custom POI](../search/search-poi.md). The list of nearby similar names will also display POIs or their categories.
- [Coordinates search](../search/search-address#coordinates-search). Enter the coordinates to find the point on the map.

#### Address Search Priorities {#address-search-priorities}

The CarPlay search feature prioritizes streets and building numbers when **searching for addresses**.

- Streets and building numbers are displayed first when you search for an address. This ensures that relevant address information is displayed before other locations such as roads or stations.
- When you search for a city, the streets within the city are displayed first, followed by the building numbers on those streets.


### Folder Last Modified {#folder-last-modified}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_last_modified.png)

The *Favorites* and *Tracks* categories have a special **Last Modified** folder. Since the list in these categories can be very large as it contains all your existing favorites or tracks, this folder is necessary for easy and quick access to your most recent destinations.


## Additional Features {#additional-features}

In addition to the basic features of the OsmAnd app in *CarPlay* that provide convenient navigation in your vehicle, there are a number of additional features that enhance your experience and make navigation more personalized, comfortable, and efficient.  


### Voice Prompts {#voice-prompts}

Voice guidance for *CarPlay* is one of OsmAnd's most useful navigation features, providing real-time guidance and allowing the driver to stay focused on the road. Voice prompts clearly indicate turns, directions and other navigation instructions, ensuring a safer and more comfortable use of the navigation system.  

To configure voice prompts according to the selected profile, you have to do this before starting a route in the OsmAnd app on your device. To see recommended settings for *CarPlay*, go to the [Voice prompts / Notifications](../navigation/guidance/voice-navigation.md) article.  


### Announce Incoming Text Messages {#announce-incoming-text-messages}

You can change the notification settings for the OsmAnd app in the system settings of your device. Tap *CarPlay*, then select one of the following items:

- *Announce New Messages*
- *Silence New Messages*
- *Remember Previous Setting*

You can also enable or disable Announce messages directly in *CarPlay*. Read about how notification management is implemented on [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925#:~:text=Go%20to%20Settings%20and%20tap,in%20the%20scheduled%20notification%20summary.) and [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph9c8438165/ios).


### Screen Alert Widget {#screen-alert-widget}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-screen-alert(1).png)  

This information widget combines alert types such as **Pedestrian crosswalks** and **Speed Limit**.

- The types of alerts have different appearance, which depends on the **<Translate android="true" ids="driving_region"/>**  and can be configured in *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,configure_profile,routing_settings_2,screen_alerts"/>*.
- In *Car Play* it is not possible to set the display of alerts, you need to configure the widget in the application before starting the navigation and connecting your device to the vehicle.
- For a detailed description of the alert types, see [this article](../widgets/nav-widgets.md#alert-types).
- To set up screen alerts for available profiles, see the article [Navigation settings](../navigation/guidance/navigation-settings.md#screen-alerts).


### Speedometer {#speedometer}

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/speedometer_carplay_2_ios.png)

**Speedometer** widget is an integrated interface element that displays *current speed* using GPS data and *speed limit* from the [OSM database](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed) and [OsmAnd settings](../navigation/guidance/voice-navigation.md#speed-limit) on the vehicle's multimedia system screen.

- The **Speedometer widget** is [*profile dependent*](../personal/profiles.md), so if you change the settings for one profile, they will not be applied to another.
- There is no option to set the display of *Speedometer* directly in *CarPlay*. You need to configure it for selected [navigation profile](#carplay-profile) in the OsmAnd application before starting the navigation and connecting your device to the vehicle.
- For more information on how to add and configure the *Speedometer* widget to the display, please read the [Informational widgets article](../widgets/info-widgets.md#speedometer).


### Map Appearance (3D) {#map-appearance-3d}

![Car Play](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_3.png)

The OsmAnd app allows you to use the 3D map view on the *CarPlay screen* to display your route and navigation.

- The **3D / 2D button** is displayed on the *CarPlay screen*.
- You can switch between 3D / 2D map modes by tapping this button.


### Multifunction Dashboard {#multifunction-dashboard}

![Car Play](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car_play_4.png)

## Volume Control Issue {#volume-control-issue}

Sometimes *CarPlay* doesn't connect, or you just can't hear anything even though it's connected. Other times, the OsmAnd app doesn't open properly in *CarPlay*. Possible solutions:  

1. In most cases, all **signals** remain at constant full volume, separate from the audio playback settings at the same time. To change the volume of the OsmAnd navigation prompts when using *CarPlay*, go to *Setup → Voice → Voice volume* on the vehicle multimedia system screen.  
2. Restart the device.
3. Make sure *CarPlay* is enabled on your iPhone. To do this:
   - Go to your phone's settings and then to *General*.
   - Go to *CarPlay* in General Settings and select *My Cars*. Here you can customize your car by forgetting it or reconnecting to it.
4. Make sure your Bluetooth is connected.
5. Check the USB cable.
6. Update your operating system regularly.
7. Check that *CarPlay* is supported in your [region](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/feature-availability/#applecarplay-applecarplay).
8. If you use a VPN on your iPhone, it may prevent *CarPlay* from working. Try disabling the VPN and see if this will help *CarPlay* to work.
