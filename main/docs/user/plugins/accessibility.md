:::caution Note
The Accessibility plugin is available only on the **Android version** of OsmAnd. The [iOS Version](#how-to-use-ios) relies on the system’s default accessibility settings.
:::

## Overview {#overview}

Accessibility improves usability for blind and visually impaired users by integrating with [Android Accessibility](https://www.android.com/accessibility/) tools. The plugin offers **text-to-speech, gesture control, automatic announcements** and **haptic feedback** to make navigation more accessible. On iOS, OsmAnd utilizes Apple's built-in accessibility features such as VoiceOver.


### How To Use (Android) {#how-to-use-android}

The Accessibility plugin offers various settings to personalize navigation and interaction for users with disabilities. These settings are applied per [profile](../personal/profiles.md) in OsmAnd.

| Setting                   | Description |  
|---------------------------|-------------|  
| **Accessibility Mode**    | Enables *built-in OsmAnd features* or uses **system settings**. |  
| **Speech Rate**           | Controls *text-to-speech speed*, ranging from **50% to 200%**. |  
| [Smart Autoannounce](#smart-autoannounce-and-clockwise-directions)    | Provides *voice guidance* when deviating from the route. |  
| **Autoannounce Period**   | Sets minimum time between announcements, from **5 seconds to 5 minutes**. |  
| **Direction Style**       | Choose between *Sidewise (8 directions)* or [Clockwise](#smart-autoannounce-and-clockwise-directions) (12 directions)*. |  
| **Audio Directions**      | Plays *audio guidances* indicating direction. |  
| **Haptic Directions**     | Provides *vibration feedback* for turns and deviations.|  

<!--
- **Accessibility Mode**. Enable special tools that help people with disabilities interact with the OsmAnd app. There are three modes: *On* - turns on the built-in OsmAnd features, *Off* - turns off all plugin features, and *According to the Android system settings* - turns on Android system settings.

- **Speech rate**. Adjust the speech rate of the text-to-speech, ranging from 50%  to 200%.

- **Smart autoannounce**. If enabled, you will receive voice announcements when you deviate from the set track.

- **Autoannounce period**. This is an automatic announcement of the direction and distance to your destination. You can select a minimal time between announcements, ranging from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.

- **Direction style**. Choose how the OsmAnd app will notify you about directions. *Sidewise* - indicates the direction to the sides of the world (8 directions), *Clockwise* - indicates directions oriented to the clock face (12 directions).

- **Audio directions**. Provides feedback when navigating by indicating the direction to the target point with sound.

- **Haptic directions**. This setting provides haptic feedback when navigating. The vibration indicates the direction to the target point and deviations from the path.

***Tips for optimized accessibility:***

- **Screen reader** - Use TalkBack (*Android*) or VoiceOver (*iOS*) for enhanced map interaction.
- **Audio navigation** - Enable auto-announce to receive voice directions while the screen is off.
- **Haptic feedback** - Ideal for low-visibility environments or when audio guidances are impractical.


#### Smart Autoannounce and Clockwise Directions {#smart-autoannounce-and-clockwise-directions}

The **Smart Autoannounce** feature provides *audio notifications* when you deviate from the planned route, while the **Clockwise Direction Style** offers *clock-face-based navigation guidances*. These features are designed to support visually impaired users who rely on *voice guidance*.  

- If **TalkBack is not enabled**, both *Smart Autoannounce* and *Clockwise Directions* will only display *text notifications* on the screen.  

- **Voice notifications** are activated only when *TalkBack* is enabled in the **device’s system settings**.  

- Set the **Autoannounce Period** (e.g., *10 seconds*) to control the frequency of announcements.
