## Overview {#overview}

With the plugin, you can set a spot on the map where your car will be left on the street and notify the calendar of the beginning of the parking time. This way, it will be easier for you to keep track of the time and location of your car.

Parking spot on the map and notification in the calendar is provided by the Parking plugin. It's free and works well with downloaded OsmAnd maps. Parking spot helps you know exactly where your car is parked and how far away you are from the parking spot. For example, it can be very useful to get back on time and avoid unnecessary expenses. The plugin also allows you to share the location with the people you want. The parking spot is easy to set up, with or without time tracking, and delete after successful use.

## Required Setup Parameters {#required-setup-parameters}

To use a parking spot on the map, you need to make the following settings:

1. Enable the [Parking position plugin](../plugins/index.md#enable--disable) in the Plugins section of the *Main Menu*.  
2. Add a [parking spot](#set-a-spot) on the map.
3. If needed, add the [Parking widget](#parking-widget) to the screen.  


## Parking Spot on the Map {#parking-spot-on-the-map}

When a parking spot appears on the map, it acquires the latitude and longitude of the selected geolocation, as well as a timestamp of exactly when it was created. This helps you visually identify the parking spot both when you set the spot and when you later track it and use it to navigate when needed.  


### Set a Spot {#set-a-spot}
