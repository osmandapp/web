## Overview {#overview}

OsmAnd Tracker is a modified Telegram client created for flexible monitoring and sending messages with GPS locations in real-time.  

[OsmAnd tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.telegram) helps you see your contacts on a map in OsmAnd. It has a social aspect to it, meaning that to use it, you need to provide access to your contacts for the platform OsmAnd chooses.  

We chose [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) s the most open social platform because it has an [Open API](https://core.telegram.org/api), Open SDK and, moreover, will eventually have an Open Server implementation (Blockchain).

### How It Works {#how-it-works}

Importantly, there is a high level of compatibility between the apps. You can easily share your location with your contacts without having the Telegram mobile app (OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker is an independent Telegram client), and conversely, your contacts do not need to have [OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.telegram) to see your location.  

We designed [OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.telegram) so that you can continue to use the Telegram app and the OsmAnd app in the way you are used to, without additional restrictions.  

The application sends Live Location messages to selected chats for the time you set, displays a list of your contacts and groups, and checks chats for messages with your location, which are then displayed on the map in OsmAnd.
The application does not send or view your text messages.  

Log in using your Telegram registered phone number to enable the following:

- Manage the list of contacts and groups that send you their location.
- View the location of contacts and groups in real time on a map in OsmAnd.
- Set the time for sharing the location separately for each chat.
- Set how often your location is updated.
- Monitor the chronology of your movements and your contacts.

## Tracker Widget {#tracker-widget}

To view the [widget](../widgets/info-widgets.md#tracker-widget-android), you need to first enable the OsmAnd Tracker plugin. After that, a widget with the word *Start* will appear in the upper right corner of the OsmAnd screen.  

To disable it, you can go to *Main Menu → Configure screen*.

![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/tracker_widget_1.png)   ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/tracker_widget_2.png)

The widget has several views.  

1. The first is *Start*.  
   When you tap *Start*, you go to [**OsmAnd Online GPS Tracker**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.telegram), where you can select any contacts or tap Suggested Contacts.
2. Second, when you start sharing your location, the widget changes its appearance.  

   - The green *OK* emoji icon means that your location is now being shared. Everything is normal, the sharing is running without errors.  
   - An orange *OK* emoji icon means your location cannot be sent. There is a problem with the Internet or GPS connection.  

   ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/11.jpg)     ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/13.jpg)

   - If you don't have an Internet connection for a long time, your location points are saved in the OsmAnd Tracker buffer. The widget in OsmAnd changes its appearance to a gray emoji icon. It shows the buffer fill time, how long the buffer already saves your location points.  

   ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/15.jpg)     ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/16.jpg)

3. As soon as the Internet connection is restored, it will start uploading location points from the buffer. The OsmAnd widget will change its appearance and the number of minutes in it will start decreasing. When all location points from the buffer are uploaded to Telegram, the emoji *OK* icon will appear on the widget.  

   ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/18.jpg)     ![OsmAnd Tracker](@site/static/img/plugins/online-tracker/23.jpg)

4. If you see widget as *OK* emoji icon, it means that everything is fine. The exchange process is going on without any problems.  


## OsmAnd Assistant {#osmand-assistant}

The OsmAnd app has its own Telegram bot called "OsmAnd Assistant," which helps you integrate OsmAnd Telegram with third-party trackers or APIs. You'll be able to share not only your location but also the location of your bike or a group of people racing available through the API. OsmAnd Telegram will give you a nice presentation of your locations on the map in OsmAnd itself.  

Please share with us what you think about this new app on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/osmandapp) and other social channels.

To view the GPS positions of contacts on the map, you need the latest version of [OsmAnd or OsmAnd+](./../purchases/android.md). The minimum supported version of OsmAnd or OsmAnd+ is 3.0.4.
