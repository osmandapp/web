# MAP {#map}

The map is a core element of OsmAnd. In this section of User guide you can find useful information on how to interact with map, how to customize map view for trekking, cycling or navigating offroad, how to configure additional POI layers or enable street level imagery etc.

## [Interact with Map](./interact-with-map.md) {#interact-with-map}

How to interact with map using buttons and gestures, so you could pan, rotate and zoom in/out the map, how to rotate the map manually or automatically by compass or by bearing and how to change zoom scale.

## [Map Context Menu](./map-context-menu.md) {#map-context-menu}

Map context menu provides information of selected object on the map and allows to share, to edit, to move or to navigate to this place.

## [Configure Map](./configure-map-menu.md) {#configure-map}

The Configure map menu is an important item on OsmAnd's *Main Menu* where you can customize the map display to suit your needs. You can highlight your favorite points, navigation markers, or special points of interest on the map; display specific routes or third-party GPX files; overlay terrain information, satellite imagery, or any other available bitmap images; display public transportation information; and change the map style.

## [Vector Maps (Map Styles)](./vector-maps.md) {#vector-maps-map-styles}

Vector maps are designed to be a default source of map data for OsmAnd, so they need to be downloaded to the device. Vector maps support a huge range of map styles for many activities like cycling, hiking, riding by car or snowmobile, etc. Each map style could be tuned to highlight or hide specific objects and switch between day and night mode. Map vector data could be augmented by vector data and displayed with default Map style, for example, Contour line information. You can create your own map style OsmAnd to display required information.

## [Raster Maps (Online / Offline)](./raster-maps.md) {#raster-maps-online--offline}

Raster maps is an extensive addition to the offline OpenStreetMap Vector maps the application uses by default. Raster maps allow to combine different map sources with Vector Maps. For example, useful Hillshade / Slope information could be displayed as a raster layer. You can display an overlay of hiking routes, live rain maps, live traffic data and an underlay of satellite imagery mixing with semi-transparent base vector map. You can also switch default maps to online web raster tiles.

## [Points on the Map](./point-layers-on-map.md) {#points-on-the-map}

On map you could display points such as Favorites, POIs, Markers, Wikipedia, Search results, Audio Video Notes, OSM Edits and others.

## [Tracks](./tracks) {#tracks}
