## Overview

:::info Paid feature
The Travel Guides is a [paid feature](../purchases/index.md) of the OsmAnd app.
:::

Virtual travel guides in OsmAnd offer users valuable information, recommendations, and tips. They also allow travelers to access comprehensive navigation information about attractions in the app.

OsmAnd travel guides are based on data from [Wikivoyage](https://www.wikivoyage.org/), a community project similar to Wikipedia, where volunteer authors create up-to-date articles.  
Wikivoyage information includes the main facts about a place, transportation, attractions, shopping, and more.

## How to use

- [Download](#download-articles) *Travel guides*.
- Browse [articles](#browse-articles) about a country, region, city, attraction.
    - Alternatively, [display travel guides articles and/or points on the map](#travel-routes) using the Configure map menu.
    - Browse through attractions on the map, add them to *[Map markers](../personal/markers.md#add-marker-on-the-map)* or *[Favorites](../personal/favorites.md#add-to-map-markers)*.
    - Using *[Read full](#manage-as-gpx-track)* button, go to the *[article](#travel-article) inside *Travel guides*.
- [Bookmark](#explore-and-bookmark) articles to read them later.
- Choose [points](#points) from articles to visit and add them to the OsmAnd map.

- [Build a route](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#set-destinations) to chosen touristic attractions or a free walk between points.

:::note
*Travel guides* articles are stored inside OsmAnd as GPX tracks with Waypoints.  After adding these tracks to the map (see *[Points](#points)* or *[Travel routes](#travel-routes)* sections of this article), you can manage them via *[My Places](../personal/myplaces.md)* menu.

### Download articles

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

Go to: *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_travel_guides"/>*

![Travel guides download menu](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_download.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Maps menu iOS](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_download_1_ios.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Before you start using travel guides, you need to download them via the [Download map menu](../start-with/download-maps.md#main-menu) (*<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,maps_and_resources,shared_string_travel_guides"/>*). The articles are grouped by regions: *Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, Central America, Europe, North America, Russia, and South America*, so you don't have to download travel books for a separate city or country.  
By saving the required regions on your device, you can browse the articles with OsmAnd even when you are abroad or out of range of your mobile network.

:::note
In addition to guides to countries, regions, or cities, you can find guides to places from movies, books, computer games, places of memory of great people, and so on.
There are also specialized guides, such as the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network list or the world's largest and most complex international airports.
:::

## Browse Articles

The *Travel guides* screen consists of two general parts: a [*search field*](#search) and a *travel guides* list with two tabs: *[<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_explore"/> and <Translate android="true" ids="saved_articles"/>](#explore-and-bookmark)*. You can switch between them with a single tap of a tab.
When you open *Travel Guides* (*<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_travel_guides"/>*), OsmAnd will show you articles about interesting places located near the geographic coordinates of the current center of the map. When you tap the item from the list, the [Travel guide article](#travel-article) opens. At the bottom of the screen is a switch to the *Bookmarks tab*.  

### Explore and Bookmark

- &nbsp;*Understand*. Details about local culture and habits.
- &nbsp;*Get in*. Details on how to get to some places and how much this route will cost.
- &nbsp;*See*. A list of attractions (museums, historical sites, and so on) with full descriptions: ticket prices, opening hours, useful links, and phone numbers.
- &nbsp;*Do*. Places to spend time.
- &nbsp;*Buy*. Sites to shop.
- &nbsp;*Eat*. Catering facilities (divided by budget: budget, mid-range, splurge).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

*Travel guide articles* often contain tourist attractions grouped by topic. By tapping once on the *Points* button at the bottom of the *[Article](#travel-article)*, all attractions related to the topic (eating places, accommodation options, airports, shops, historical monuments, and so on) will be added to the map and can be *[managed as a Track](#manage-as-gpx-track)*.  

By default, attraction groups are marked with certain icons: *Eat and Drink* categories with a knife and fork in a red circle, *Do and See* with a camera in a green circle, and others. You can manage groups of points with &#8942; like a *[Waypoint folder](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md#waypoints-folder)*.  

:::note
Points in *Travel articles* refer to waypoints on a GPX track.  
You can also *[add points to the map](#travel-routes)* in the *Configure map* menu. You can display them all or select a specific category.  
:::


## Travel routes

*<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,configure_map,travel_routes"/>*

An alternative way to browse *Travel guides* is to display them on the map using the *Configure map* menu. This feature does not apply to the ability provided by OsmAnd to use Wikivoyage, it only applies to tracks. You can read more in our [blog](https://osmand.net/blog/routes#generated-travel-routes).

![Travel guides points menu](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_travel_routes_path.png) ![Travel guides points menu](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_travel_routes_view.png)


### Travel routes and articles on the map

![Travel guides points  menu](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_articles_routes_on_the_map.png) ![Travel guides points  menu](@site/static/img/guides/travel_guides_articles_routes_context_menu.png)  

After you enable the *Travel routes* display in the *Configure map* menu, circles of different colors will appear on the map. The orange ones represent route tracks, route articles, and some waypoints. Tap a specific route, article, or point and then tap the *Download* button (&#9047;), and you can [manage them as a track](#manage-as-gpx-track).

### Custom Travel guides

We recommend you add new articles or edits to [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/). We update the Travel guides about every 6 months, and you can download new articles. You can also create your own *Travel book*. How to make it is described in technical documentation (see *[Create custom Travel guide](../../technical/map-creation/create_travel_guide.md)* article).

After you add *Travel guides* to the map, *Travel articles* can be saved as a GPX track and managed through the *[My places](../personal/myplaces.md)* menu (*<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_my_places,shared_string_tracks,icon_group_travel"/>*). They can be displayed on the map, shared, renamed, placed in another folder, exported, or deleted.  

- &nbsp;In *[Overview](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md#overview)*, you can read a brief description or open [Travel guide article](#travel-article) by taping *Read full* button. *Edit* allows you to correct the article.
- &nbsp;There is no information in the *[Track](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md#altitude--speed-graphs)* section,  the GPX files of *Travel guides* contain only waypoints.  
- &nbsp;Under *[Points](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md#points--waypoints)* you see folders with points grouped by name (Buy, Do, Drink, and so on).
- &nbsp;The *[Option](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md#options)* button performs the same functions as in the regular track.

:::info
*Points* are stored in a [GPX-file](../../technical/osmand-file-formats/osmand-gpx.md) (a commonly used format for tracks) as [Waypoints](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#track-waypoints). The number of points (waypoints) in the track contains is marked next to the icon &#128681; in the track field.  
In *[track context menu](../map/tracks/track-context-menu.md)* of GPX-file you can find general information about the article to which this track belongs.
