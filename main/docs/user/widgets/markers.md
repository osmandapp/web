## Overview {#overview}

Markers are temporary points indicated on the map in the form of flags. The widgets show the *Direction*, *Distance*, *Address*, and *Estimated arrival time* to the marker. They allow you to quickly find markers on the map, as well as change their position. You can read more about markers in this [article](../personal/markers).  


## Top Bar Widget {#top-bar-widget}

The **Map markers bar** (Android) widget / **Distance indication - Top bar** (iOS) widget displays:

- Distance from your current location (or the centre map point / the initial map touching point when the Location is off) to the selected point indicated by the Marker on the map ([Units of length](../personal/profiles/#general-settings) can be chosen in the Profile settings).
- An arrow of the same color as the marker indicates the direction from the current location (or the centre map point / the initial map touching point when the Location is off) and orientation in space of your device (heading) towards the marker.
- Location Address.
- Menu icon leading to [Map marker list](../personal/markers/#map-markers-menu).

You can also select to display one or two markers. Read more about widget settings in this [article](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/markers#map-markers-widgets).
:::info
*The distance to the marker* is the length of the straight line between your position (or the centre map point / the initial map touching point when the Location is off) and the marker.

## Panel Widgets {#panel-widgets}

The **Map markers** *(for Android)* widget and **Distance indication - Widgets** *(for iOS)* displays:

- *Distance from your current location* to the selected point indicated by the Marker on the map ([Units of length](../personal/profiles/#general-settings) can be choosed in the Profile settings).
- *Estimated time of arrival or ETA*.  
This is the time (hh:mm) when the vehicle or person should arrive at the destination. It is calculated as the distance to the marker divided by the average speed.
The average speed is calculated as the mean of all speed values received from location points for the time interval you selected from 15 seconds to 60 minutes.

You can also select to display one or two markers. Read more about widget settings in this [article](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/markers#map-markers-widgets).

*The distance to the marker* is the length of the straight line between your position (or a particular point on the map) and the marker.
