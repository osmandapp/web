## Supported Cross-Platform Purchases {#supported-cross-platform-purchases}

The following OsmAnd products currently support use across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and Web):

- **OsmAnd Pro** subscription  
- **Maps+** subscription  
- **Maps+** one-time in-app purchase

Starting with **OsmAnd version 5.0**, released in celebration of our **15th anniversary**, cross-platform access has been extended to **Maps+** (formerly known as *Unlimited*). Previously, only the [OsmAnd Pro](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#cross-platform) subscription was cross-platform.  

To activate cross-platform access, purchases must be linked to your [OsmAnd Cloud](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login) account.  
You can compare all OsmAnd products here: [difference between purchases](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android/#difference-between-purchases)

| Product Type                | Cross-Platform | Notes |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------|
| OsmAnd Pro (subscription)   | ✔              | Works across Android, iOS, and Web via Cloud |
| Maps+ (subscription)        | ✔              | Requires version 5.0+ and Cloud account |
| Maps+ (one-time purchase)   | ✔              | Must be activated through OsmAnd Cloud on purchase device |
| OsmAnd+ (standalone app)    | Coming soon    | Not transferable between stores or platforms |


## How It Works {#how-it-works}

To use your **OsmAnd Pro** or **Maps+** purchase across different platforms (Android, iOS, or Web), you need to **link it to your OsmAnd Cloud account**.

### Link Your Purchase {#link-your-purchase}

![Cloud link](@site/static/img/purchases/cloud_activation.png)

Perform this step on the **device where you made the purchase** (Android or iOS, version 5.0 or later):

1. Go to your [OsmAnd Cloud account](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login):  
   *Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud → Create new account / I already have an account*

2. Once logged in, your **Pro or Maps+** purchase will be automatically linked to your **Cloud account** and marked as **cross-platform**.


### Activate on Another Device or Platform {#activate-on-another-device-or-platform}

1. Go to your [OsmAnd Cloud account](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login):  
   *Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud →* ***Log in with the same account***

2. Then go to:  
   *Menu → Settings → Purchases*  
   Your linked **Pro or Maps+** purchase should now be available.


### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you don't see your purchase listed:

1. Tap *Menu → Settings → Purchases → Restore purchases*  
2. Ensure you are logged in to the **same OsmAnd Cloud account** used on the original device.

If the issue persists, contact **support@osmand.net** and include:

- Your OsmAnd Cloud email.
- Platform(s) and app store(s) used.
- Type of purchase (Pro / Maps+ one-time / Maps+ subscription).


## Example {#example}

You purchased **Maps+** as a one-time in-app purchase in the free version of OsmAnd from the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/OsmAnd-Maps-Navigation/dp/B00D0SA8I8).  
Later, you decide to switch to an iPhone and want to use **Maps+** with the [OsmAnd iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257).

To activate your Maps+ purchase on iOS:

1. Open the **Amazon version** of the OsmAnd app on your original device.
2. Log in to your [OsmAnd Cloud account](../personal/osmand-cloud.md#login):  
   *Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud → Create new account / I already have an account*
3. Install OsmAnd on your iPhone from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257)
4. Log in to the **same OsmAnd Cloud account** on your iPhone.
5. Go to *Menu → Settings → Purchases* and confirm that **Maps+** is listed as active.

This completes the cross-platform activation of your purchase. You can now continue using **Maps+** on your new device.

Enjoy using Maps+/Pro across platforms!
