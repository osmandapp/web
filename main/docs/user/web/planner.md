## Overview {#overview}

The OsmAnd Web Route Planner allows you to create navigation routes, plan tracks, and manage local files directly from your browser. This web tool is useful for creating detailed travel routes that you can sync to your app or share with others.


## Navigation Route {#navigation-route}

To create a navigation route, follow these steps:

- **Right-click** on the map to add waypoints:

  - *Navigate from*. Set the starting point.
  - *Navigate to*. Set the destination.
  - *Navigate via*. Add intermediate points if needed.

- After setting the start and end points, the route will be displayed on the map.

- In the **Route** block:

  - Move the start and end points if needed.
  - Edit the waypoints and choose the desired route type (e.g., car, bicycle, walking).

- Click on the orange circles along the route to view detailed navigation instructions.

- To share the route, copy the URL. Example: [https://test.osmand.net/map/?start=43.792163,11.215324&finish=43.852850,11.121941&via=43.812605,11.134644&type=osmand&profile=bicycle#13/43.8200/11.1352](https://test.osmand.net/map/?start=43.792163,11.215324&finish=43.852850,11.121941&via=43.812605,11.134644&type=osmand&profile=bicycle#13/43.8200/11.1352)


## Create Track and Local Files {#create-track-and-local-files}

OsmAnd Web's [**Plan route**](../plan-route/create-route.md) tool allows you to create and edit tracks similarly to the mobile app. Here's how you can create and manage tracks:


***Creating a new route:***

- Alternatively, use the **Create Track** button in the *Local* menu (located on the right side with the *Pencil* and *Upload* buttons).

- **Add Waypoints**. Click on the map to add new points.
- **Save the Route**. Save your route for future use.
- **View Route Details**. Access detailed track information, including length, duration, and terrain.
