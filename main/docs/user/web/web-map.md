The *[osmand.net/map](https://osmand.net/map/)* site is currently being developed and tested.  
**Therefore, the layout and operation of some functions on the site may be different from those described in this article.**

We created the [Discussion theme](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/discussions/16567) on our GitHub so you can leave feedback there.

## Overview {#overview}

The OsmAnd web map is a global map based on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. It allows users to view their own data, such as tracks and favorites, create navigation routes for any profile, and access additional features like weather, public GPX tracks, POIs, and Wikimedia images. Explore and customize your data experience directly in your browser.

2. **URL without a pin on the map:**
