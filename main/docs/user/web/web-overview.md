## What is OsmAnd Web Map Viewer?

The [**OsmAnd Map Portal**](https://osmand.net/map) — also referred to as the **Web Map Viewer** — is a browser-based extension of the OsmAnd mobile app. It allows users to view global maps, plan routes, simulate navigation, manage personal data, and access synced content from their devices via the cloud.

Designed as a cross-platform companion to OsmAnd for Android and iOS, the Web Map Viewer helps users plan trips, analyze tracks, view terrain, and manage files using any desktop or tablet browser — without installing an app.

OsmAnd Web integrates tightly with the **OsmAnd Cloud** service, which enables syncing favorites, tracks, and backups across devices and platforms. Users with **OsmAnd Start** (free) or **OsmAnd Pro** (paid) accounts can take full advantage of this ecosystem by syncing data between mobile and web.
