## Cross-Platform Purchases {#cross-platform-purchases}

**OsmAnd Pro** and **Maps+** (*All World Maps* for iOS) are **cross-platform subscriptions** available for Android and iOS starting with OsmAnd 5.0. Cross-platform means that if you purchase a subscription, for example, in one of the Android stores (Google Play, Huawei AppGallery), you can also use it on iOS and in the web version.

- Cross-platform subscription can be used on multiple devices and platforms **if linked to the same OsmAnd Cloud account**.

- One-time purchases such as **OsmAnd+** (Android) and store-specific purchases are not transferable between platforms.

- You can use OsmAnd Pro on up to 6 devices, even if they run different operating systems.

- Always ensure you're using the same OsmAnd Cloud account across all devices to access your purchases.

- For more details, see: [Android purchases](../purchases/android.md), [iOS purchases](../purchases/ios.md), and [OsmAnd Map Portal](https://www.osmand.net/map).

## Amazon store is closing - what to do {#amazon-store-is-closing---what-to-do}

On **August 20, 2025**, Amazon will shut down the Amazon Appstore for Android devices. You can read the official announcement [here](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/blogs/2025/02/upcoming-changes-to-amazon-appstore-for-android-devices-and-coins-program).

If you have made purchases via Amazon, you will need to **transfer your subscriptions (Pro, Maps+) or in-app (Maps+) purchases** to another platform.

➡️ Currently, [cross-platform transfer is possible for subscriptions and in-app purchases](../purchases/cross.md).  
❗ **OsmAnd+** (standalone app) cannot be transferred between platforms via OsmAnd Cloud account. For assistance, please contact **support@osmand.net**.

## How to restore the Topography (formerly Contour lines) plugin purchase {#how-to-restore-the-topography-formerly-contour-lines-plugin-purchase}

To restore the [Topography plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.srtmPlugin.paid):

1. Log into the same Google Play account used to purchase the Topography plugin, and install [the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.srtmPlugin.paid).
2. If the *Install* button is inactive, ensure that both the Google Play and OsmAnd apps are up to date. Clear their cache, restart your device, and try installing the plugin again.
3. After installation, enable the Topography plugin in the *[OsmAnd menu → Plugins](../plugins/topography.md)*, download the required files in the *[Maps and Resources](../start-with/download-maps.md#maps-and-resources)*, and activate it through the *[Configure map menu](../map/configure-map-menu.md)*.


## How to identify if OsmAnd Unlimited is active {#how-to-identify-if-osmand-unlimited-is-active}

Navigate to *Menu → Download maps* and tap the map counter (the field labeled *Free version. X downloads left*). If OsmAnd Unlimited is active, the display will show the remaining device storage instead of the number of free downloads.


## Can I get the full version of OsmAnd as a separate app for iOS? {#can-i-get-the-full-version-of-osmand-as-a-separate-app-for-ios}

For iOS, there is only one version of OsmAnd available. To access the full version, you need to unlock additional functions through in-app purchases.


## What do 5 or 7 free downloads mean? {#what-do-5-or-7-free-downloads-mean}

You are allowed 5 free downloads on iOS or 7 on Android. Each download, whether it's a map, an update (map updates count as downloads), voice packs, or other items, reduces the available count. Please note, that removing items from your downloads does not restore the free download count.


## How can I get additional map downloads in OsmAnd Free? {#how-can-i-get-additional-map-downloads-in-osmand-free}

If you have used all 5 (iOS) or 7 (Android) free downloads, you can receive 3 extra downloads by *subscribing to the mailing list*. A banner with the subscription option will appear once all free downloads have been used.


## Verification Code for OsmAnd Cloud Not Received {#verification-code-for-osmand-cloud-not-received}

If you do not receive the **verification code** when creating an **OsmAnd Cloud** account, follow these steps to resolve the issue:  

1. Check your email address.  
    Ensure that you have entered the **correct email address**. The email should match the one used for purchasing **OsmAnd Pro** or registering your **OsmAnd Cloud** account.  

2. Check spam folders.  
    Sometimes, the verification email may be filtered as spam. Look for an email from **OsmAnd** in your **Spam**, **Junk**, or **Promotions** folders.  

3. Wait for the code to arrive.  
    In some cases, the activation code email may be **delayed**. Avoid **multiple activation attempts** within a short period, as this can cause additional delays.  

4. Try resending the code.  
    Return to the **OsmAnd Cloud login screen** and select **Resend Code** if available. Wait a few minutes before requesting another code.  

5. Verify email server restrictions.  
    If you are using a **corporate or custom email domain**, check with your **email provider** to ensure the email is not being blocked. Consider using a different email service (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) if issues persist.
