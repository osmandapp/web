## Overview {#overview}

[OsmAnd Point of Interest](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Points_of_interest) (POI) functionality in OsmAnd provides accuracy, visibility, and convenience in finding interesting places, routes and services near your current location or a selected area on the map.  

The search bar allows you to enter keywords related to the places you are interested in. The POI search also presents a convenient list sorted by [category](#poi-search-by-categories) to help you quickly find what you are looking for, and the [filter](#save-new-custom-filters) allows you to select specific POI characteristics to display only relevant results.  

[Custom Search](#custom-poi-search) enhances search functionality by allowing multiple category and subcategory choices. You can save created filters for future use, making it easier to quickly locate POIs that meet specific criteria or preferences. For more details, refer to the section on saving custom filters [here](#save-new-custom-filters).  

OsmAnd provides several ways to get to the Search tool where the **Categories search** section is located.

- The [Search button](../widgets/map-buttons.md#search) is always displayed on the map, and tapping it will take you to the tool's [general screen](#how-to-use), where you can find the *Categories* tab.
- Go to the main *Menu → Search → Categories tab*.
- When preparing to start a route, tap [*Navigation → Set destination → Search field → Categories tab*](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#set-target-point).  
- Go to the main [*Menu → Configure map → POI overlay → Search*](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#points-of-interest-pois).


## How to Use {#how-to-use}

*All POI types in OsmAnd you can find here:* [gitHub link](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/dd575efb5aa4ec7e359bb50e8dc6de7c358ff258/poi/poi_types.xml).

- **Point of Interest (POI) search:**
    - Allows you to search:
       - for nearby or specific categories of points of interest (POI).
       - for [OSM routes](../map/routes.md).
       - for [Popular places (Wikipedia)](../map/map-context-menu.md#details).

    - Filters and sorting results by category, distance, or rating are possible.

    - Search results show the location of the POI, its contact information, ratings, and reviews.

- **Search POIs by category directly on the map**:
    - You need to select the required categories from the [**list**](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#points-of-interest-pois) in *Configure map → Show POI overlay...* and search by icons in the expected location.

    - *Android*: You can start searching for POIs in *Menu → Search → Categories*.

- **Brand search:**
    - When entering a business venue or brand name (such as Audi, Starbucks, or Aldi), the list of search results is ordered with priority by POI name and sorted by distance from the corresponding location.

    - The name of the locality is displayed alongside each search result to help you identify the right location among others at a similar distance from you.

    - This type of search is convenient to use if a retail outlet specializes in selling goods or services of one brand or if the brand itself is better known and more recognizable than the name or category of the POI.

    - To perform a search, the tag `brand` and brand names must be added to the POI description.

    - Example of a car shop: *POI type* - Car dealer, *name* - Octo Automobile, [***brand*** *name*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:brand) - Audi, BMW, Fiat, Jaguar, Land Rover.  

    ![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/brand_search_andr.png)


:::note
To accomplish some of these tasks (locate addresses, POI) you will need to have the offline vector map file. Initially, the search is based on data located on the map in the visible area of the device screen. If you find nothing, OsmAnd proposes to increase the search radius.

## POI Search by Categories {#poi-search-by-categories}

The **Search by Categories** tool allows you to quickly find objects, places, and routes classified into different categories. Each category has a unique set of characteristics, and this tool has filters that allow you to refine the search results by selecting different values for additional characteristics.

How it works:

- *Category Selection* - You select the category you are interested in, such as restaurants, hotels, stores, OSM routes, popular Wikipedia places and others, from a suggested list of categories.
- *Characteristic Filters* - After selecting a category, the application shows additional characteristics that can be used to refine the search. For example, for the Restaurants category, you can select filters such as cuisine type (Italian, Chinese, etc.), price range, rating, and parking availability.
- *Applying Filters* - You select the required values in the filters, and then the application applies these filters to the search results to show only those properties that match the specified characteristics.
- *Displaying results* - After applying filters, the OsmAnd displays a list with brief information matching the category and characteristics set.

Benefits:

- *User Customization* - Feature filters allow you to customize searches to meet their specific needs and preferences.
- *Refined results* - Filters help refine search results, making them more relevant and accurate.
- *Multiple Categories* - The OpenStreetMap database has an extensive set of POI categories, allowing you to find sites of different types and categories.

<!--
POI category search allows you to quickly find and select places of interest based on your needs. It is a handy tool for traveling, finding nearby services or places of interest, and planning routes based on selected POI categories.  

OsmAnd starts to find names and categories of POI by entered words. First results will be categories, second resolts will be POI with additional info, full name, categorie name, direction and distance to POI, work time. Pressing to needed categorie opens POI list of this categorie. 

Tapping to chosen POI in the list opens [Map Context menu](../map/map-context-menu.md#select-an-object-single-tap) of POI.

![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/search_poi_rearrange_del_andr.png)  


### Online Search {#online-search}

<InfoAndroidOnly />

![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/search_online_2_andr.png)  

**Online Search** allows finding locations, addresses, and points of interest in real time. OsmAnd uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html), an online geocoder developed by OpenStreetMap that translates users' text queries into geographic coordinates and back ([*example*](#example-of-online-search-query)).  

Online Search includes the following features:

1. **Search by location** - You can enter the name of a city, street, neighborhood, or other location and OsmAnd will provide results matching the query.
2. **Geocoding** - Online search converts your text queries into geographic coordinates, allowing precise location.
3. **Reverse geocoding** - You can enter geographic coordinates and Search will return the corresponding location as a city name, street name, or place on the map.
4. **Search by Points of Interest** - Allows you to search for different points by name or category.

Use of Online Search:

- Online search ensures that data is up-to-date and updates are available, as the service is constantly updated and uses open data sources.
- It provides a wide coverage of places and objects, allowing you to find places of interest in different regions of the world.
- Online searches are real-time, providing quick access to search results.
- Useful in cities and on highways with good Internet coverage.
- Online search is convenient to use if there are no maps of the region and if it is impossible to download them.
- *Requires a constant and stable Internet connection.*  

![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/search_poi_online_increase2_andr.png)  

To improve results, before using the Search tool, zoom in on the map to get closer to where you need to find a specific location. And while searching, you can **increase the search radius** to find places that are farther away from your location. When searching offline, if the required results are not available, OsmAnd suggests using the online search.  

You can find out information about Online Navigation in [Online routing](../navigation/routing/online-routing.md) article.

#### Example of Online Search Query {#example-of-online-search-query}

*Nominatim* in OsmAnd is used as a search engine for OpenStreetMap data, with which you can search by name (search by address is currently disabled). Each result has a link to a detail page to see what data about the object is stored in the database.  

**Example XML file.** This XML file does not contain any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown in the [link](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=xml&addressdetails=0&accept-language=en&q=%D0%9C%D1%96%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA+%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%86%D1%96+72+&addressdetails=1&limit=300).


## Custom POI Search {#custom-poi-search}

Custom POI Search is an advanced search feature that allows you to find POIs from different categories and combine them for a more accurate and personalized search. Unlike the standard POI search, which is limited to some predefined categories, the Custom POI search provides the flexibility to select and combine different types of POIs.  

For example, you can search restaurants and pharmacies simultaneously to find the nearest place to dine and then take your medicine. Or search for the nearest gas station and car service when you have a problem with your car.  

This functionality is especially useful in various cases:  

- *Travel*. When traveling, using custom search you can quickly find different places of interest and combine them to create an optimal route.
- *Emergencies*. If you need to find several types of services quickly, you can use a custom POI search to get all the information you need.
- *Search for nearby services*. Custom Search allows you to combine different POI categories for easy search if you need to find several types of services in a certain neighborhood or on a certain section of the route.

*Custom POI filter* includes sets of amenity categories consisting of relevant values. OsmAnd allows you to collect and combine the required POI types from one or more suggested categories.  

To create custom filters for finding places on the map, select relevant categories and subcategories of interest. You can [save](#save-new-custom-filters) these filters for later use or [edit](#edit-an-existing-filter) them if needed. Alternatively, you can view the filtered data without saving by tapping the *Show* button. However, note that if you don't save the filters, all selections will be canceled once you switch searches or exit the search tool.

- Each amenity category contains a list of available generic values for POI types.
- You have the option to select or deselect them individually by tapping the field of the type you are interested in.
- *Select all* - To do this, select the toggle button.
- Refine the list by excluding unnecessary ones - Start typing the suggested name in the *Search for POI types* field.
