## Overview {#overview}

**Search** is a useful tool for quickly finding locations. You can use Search to find a location by address, coordinates, points of interest (POI), or previous searches. Search [Address](#search-address) allows you to enter the address you want to get an exact location. [Coordinates](#search-coordinates) search works with geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude. With [POI](#search-poi) search you can search for nearby places in specific categories, such as cafés, hotels, or filling stations. Search [History](#search-history) saves past searches for quick access to previously found places. The search feature makes it easy to plan trips, navigate unknown terrain, and find POIs nearby.


## How to Use {#how-to-use}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Search POI list Android](@site/static/img/search/poi_list_android.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Search POI list iOS](@site/static/img/search/poi_list_1_ios.png)  

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You need to follow one of the steps to start your search:

- Tap the [Search button](../widgets/map-buttons.md#search) on the map application screen and enter your query.

- Go to the main *Menu → Search → enter your search query*.

- When preparing to start a route, tap [*Navigation → Set destination → Search field*](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#set-target-point) *→ search query*.  


Important information:

- ***Downloaded offline vector maps are required to search with OsmAnd***.

- Initially, **the search is based on the data located on the map in the visible area of the device screen**, but if nothing is found there, OsmAnd offers to increase the search radius.  

### Basic Queries {#basic-queries}

***Query list*:**

- Coordinates all available formats.
- Address:
    - Street, House Number;
    - City, Street;
    - Street Intersections;
    - City;
    - Tiger data;
    - Postal Code, House Number;
    - Postal Code, Street, House Number.
- Search POI by name and by category with additional filters.
- Search OSM routes by name and by category with additional filters.
- Search by most prominent peaks and volcanoes.
- Search by Favorites and Waypoints.
- Search icons by POI subcategory names.
- Search by tracks.
- Search by business venues and brand names.
- Online search (Nominatim).
- URL search (Google and OsmAnd).
- Search History.

<!--
***Supported formats*:**  

***Tags*** can be used as a search query. They consist of ***a key and a value***, for example:
*addr:street=StreetName*.  
To avoid confusion, sometimes the key or value is surrounded by quotation marks: **key="value" or "key"="value"**. The quotation marks and equal sign are not part of the tag content.
-->

### Sorting Search Results {#sorting-search-results}

OsmAnd automatically sorts search results by three main criteria:

1. **Matching queries** — Results containing exact or partial matches to the words you entered are displayed higher.

2. **Object type** - When sorting by name, cities, and streets are prioritized over POIs when displaying results.

3. **Distance** - When results have similar matching criteria and object types, the results closest to the user's current location are shown first.

***For example***, a search query *post office* will show the nearest post offices first, even if there are other items with similar names at a greater distance.  

***Current limitations:***

- There is no manual setting to change the sorting order of search results.
- The sorting process is **automatically managed** by OsmAnd, based on the criteria listed above.
- In cases where search results are too broad, OsmAnd can **limit the displayed results** to those with the highest word match accuracy.


### Full Text Search {#full-text-search}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Favorite search Android](@site/static/img/search/favorite_search_android.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Favorite search iOS](@site/static/img/search/favorite_search_ios.png)  

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can find the required location on the map from the list of points that appear as you enter a query.

1. Start typing the name or address in the search bar.

2. As you type, the list displays the points closest to the query, in roughly this order:
    - POI Categories
    - Favorites, POI, Routes, and Waypoints
    - Tracks
    - Addresses
    - Maps to download

3. If you enter a [brand name](../search/search-poi.md#how-to-use), the list will start with results by this name, sorted by closest distance.

:::note TIGER data limitations in address searches
OsmAnd has integrated [**TIGER data**](../../technical/algorithms/trace-address-search-issues.md#trace-address-search-issues#us-address-search-and-tiger-data) into the US maps to provide information about US addresses. TIGER dataset is **range-based** and does not contain precise house numbers, so some addresses may be missing or inaccurate.

### Search on the Map {#search-on-the-map}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/poi_overlay_android.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">  

![Search POI iOS](@site/static/img/search/poi_overlay_ios.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

OsmAnd allows you to search for points displayed on a map on your device's screen. To do this:

- Use [one of the ways](#how-to-use) to get to the Search tool.
- Start typing the name or address into the search box.
- A box with the *Show on map* button will appear below the search input field.
- Tap this button to go to the map.
- You can continue typing your query at the top of the screen.


### Search Nearby {#search-nearby}

![Search Android](@site/static/img/search/search_all_near_location_andr.png)

You can use the search in the vicinity of a specific location. To do this, select the required point [from the list in the search menu](#full-text-search) or select it directly on the map. In the [map context menu](../map/map-context-menu.md#actions), select *Actions → Search nearby*.


## Search Address {#search-address}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Search Android](@site/static/img/search/search_address_2_andr.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Search iOS](@site/static/img/search/street_search_ios.png)  

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Search Address** uses OpenStreetMap data. This type of search allows you to find the location and direction to a specific address from a ready-sorted list. Read more in the [Search Address](./search-address.md) article.


## Search History {#search-history}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![History search](@site/static/img/search/history_search_android.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![History search](@site/static/img/search/history_search_ios.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can use the **Search History** to search again for previously found places, addresses, or frequently visited places without entering the query again.. More details can be found in the [Search History](./search-history.md) article.


## Search POI {#search-poi}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Search POI Android](@site/static/img/search/search_poi_categoties_andr.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Search POI iOS](@site/static/img/search/search_poi_categoties_1_ios.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The **Search POI** is a list, sorted by category, with which you can easily find places and services near your current location or a selected area on the map.

- [Custom POI search](./search-poi.md#custom-poi-search) allows you to combine different POI categories to simplify and personalize your search.  
For example, if you need to find several types of services in a certain area or on a certain section of a route.

- OsmAnd provides an [Online search](./search-poi.md#online-search) that works in real-time, giving you quick access to search results.  
It is convenient to use when maps of the region are unavailable, but a constant and stable Internet connection is required.

- Read the [Search POI](./search-poi.md) article for more information.


## Search Coordinates {#search-coordinates}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

![Search Coordinates Android](@site/static/img/search/coordinates_search_android.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

![Search Coordinates iOS](@site/static/img/search/coordinates_search_ios.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Coordinate search provides an accurate location. You can enter precise coordinates obtained, for example, from other sources such as a map, GPS device, or online services, which is particularly useful when it comes to places that do not have an exact address. For more information, see the [Search Coordinates](./search-coordinates.md) article.
