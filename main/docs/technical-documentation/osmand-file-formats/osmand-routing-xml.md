# Routing Configuration - .routing.xml

{% data reusables.general.article-not-complete %}

Routing.xml is a configuration file that stores multiple routing profiles. Each profile is independent and has only base OsmAnd profile as a reference that's why it's not possible to create a hierarchy of profiles and you will need to copy all rule sections.

Please check the documentation inside routing.xml:

- Other exsmples https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/routing
