## What's new {#whats-new}

- New experimental Starwatcher plugin with an astronomical overlay that shows the paths of the Sun, planets and stars on the map, with time and date selection and a dedicated activity screen.
- Improved **[OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud)** section in Settings: backup data, version history and automatic backup settings are now grouped under a single “OsmAnd Cloud” block with clearer names, icons and storage usage information.
- Updated **[Configure map](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu)** options for routes and road attributes: a clearer legend, better filters for hiking, cycling and MTB networks, plus more control over which route types and icon overlays are visible on the map.
- New and redesigned elevation and navigation widgets: elevation profiles for routes and GPX tracks, uphill/downhill metrics, average grade and more detailed elevation information for trips and navigation.
- **[Android Auto](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/auto-car)** improvements, including extended widget support and better OBD II integration, so key vehicle metrics such as speed and fuel-related data are easier to see on the car screen.
- More flexible layout for widgets and map buttons: improved placement in landscape mode, better control over visibility and appearance, and a layout that reduces overlaps between widgets, buttons and data fields.
- Enhanced Favorites management in **[My Places](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/myplaces)**: more powerful folder handling and multiselection for favorites, plus groundwork for attaching media (photos, videos, audio notes) directly to favorite points.
- Smarter track organization and statistics: Smart Folders can automatically group tracks by period, activity, distance, speed, location and other parameters, with clearer summary statistics for each group.
- Advanced route and track analysis: new graphs for road type, surface, smoothness, steepness, lanes and maximum speed, together with an option to color tracks using a fixed speed palette.
- Ongoing improvements to accessibility features, including more flexible audio and haptic navigation indications and a richer “look around” experience for visually impaired users.
- Initial groundwork for smartwatch integration, preparing support for viewing navigation information and trip recording data on wearable devices.


## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}
