[**OsmAndMapCreator**](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAndMapCreator) can be used to create any maps supported by OsmAnd yourself. You can download latest version from [website](https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAndMapCreator-main.zip). OsmAndMapCreator has UI capabilities to create raster & vector maps. To create vector map you will need OSM file (`*.pbf, *.osm.gz, *.osm.bz2`) and to create online sqlite map file you will need a `base tile url`.
